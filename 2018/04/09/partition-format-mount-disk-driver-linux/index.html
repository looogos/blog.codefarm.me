Partioning is typically the fist step of preparing a newly manufactured disk, before any files or directories have been created. The disk stores the information about the partions’ location and sizes in an area known as the partion table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partion then apears in the operating system as a distinct “logical” disk that use part of the actual disk. System administrators use a program called a partion editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. When a hard driver is installed in a computer, it must be partioned before you can format and use it. Partioning a driver is when you divide the total storage of a driver into different pieces. These pieces are call partions. Once a partion is created, it can then be formatted so that it can be used on a computer. Primary, Extended, and Logical Partitions When partitioning, you’ll need to be aware of the difference between primary, extended, and logical partitions. A disk with a traditional partition table can only have up to four partitions. Extended and logical partitions are a way to get around this limitation. Each disk can have up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition. If you need four partitions or less, you can just create them as primary partitions. However, let’s say you want six partitions on a single drive. You’d have to create three primary partitions as well as an extended partition. The extended partition effectively functions as a container that allows you to create a larger amount of logical partitions. So, if you needed six partitions, you’d create three primary partitions, an extended partition, and then three logical partitions inside the extended partition. You could also just create a single primary partition, an extended partition, and five logical partitions — you just can’t have more than four primary partitions at a time. Partition a new disk Use this command lsblk to list available disks: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 0 20G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 0 19.1G 0 part / ├─sda2 8:2 0 1K 0 part └─sda5 8:5 0 880M 0 part [SWAP] sdb 8:16 0 20G 0 disk └─sdb1 8:17 0 20G 0 part /data sdc 8:32 0 20G 0 disk Also you can use command fdisk or lsscsi: fdisk -l|grep &#39;Disk /dev&#39; Disk /dev/sdb: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors Disk /dev/sda: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors Disk /dev/sdc: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors lsscsi [0:0:0:0] disk VMware, VMware Virtual S 1.0 /dev/sda [0:0:1:0] disk VMware, VMware Virtual S 1.0 /dev/sdb [0:0:2:0] disk VMware, VMware Virtual S 1.0 /dev/sdc Use the command fdisk /dev/[sda,sdb, ..., hda, hdb, ...] to partition the new disk: fdisk /dev/sdc The basic fdisk commands you need are: m – print help p – print the partition table n – create a new partition d – delete a partition q – quit without saving changes w – write the new partition table and exit EIDE devices are identifier as hda, hdb, hdc, and hdd in the /dev directory. Partitions on these disk can range from 1 to 16 and are also in the /dev directory. For example, /dev/hda4 refers to partion 4 on hard disk a (fist EIDE hard disk). SCSI devices are listed as devices sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde, sdf, and sdg in the /dev directory. Similarly, partions on these disks can range from 1 to 16 and also in the /dev directory. For example, /dev/sda3 refers to partions 3 on SCSI disk a (fisrt SCSI hard disk). Disk formatting Disk formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard disk driver, solid-state driver, floppy disk or USB flash driver for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. The first part ot formatting process that performs basic medium preparation is often referred to as “low-level formatting”. Partioning is the common term for the second part of the process, making the data storage visible to an operating system. The third part of the process, usually termed “high-level formatting” most often refers to the process of generating a new file system. In some operating systems all or parts of these three processes can be combined or repeated at different levels and the term “format” is understood to mean an operation in which a new disk medium is fully prepared to store files. Creating an ext2, or ext3, or ext4, or xfs filesystem Once you’ve partioned your hard disk using fdisk command, use make2fs to create ext2, ext3, ext4 or xfs file system. Create an ext2 file system: mke2fs /dev/sdc1 Create an ext3 file system: mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -j /dev/sda1 Create an ext4 file system: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sda1 Create an xfs file system: mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -t xfs /dev/sda1 Converting ext2 to ext3 For example, if you are upgrading /dev/sda2 that is mounted as /home, from ext2 to ext3, do the following. umount /dev/sda2 tune2fs -j /dev/sda2 mount /dev/sda2 /home Note: You really don’t need to umount and mount it, as ext2 to ext3 conversion can happen on a live file system. But, I feel better doing the conversion offline. Converting ext3 to ext4 If you are upgrading /dev/sda2 that is mounted as /home, from ext3 to ext4, do the following. umount /dev/sda2 tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda2 e2fsck -pf /dev/sda2 mount /dev/sda2 /home Again, try all of the above commands only on a test system, where you can afford to lose all your data. Mount Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and diretories on a storage device (such as hard driver, CD-ROM, or network share) available for user to access via the computer’s file system. In general, the process of mounting comprises operating system acquiring access to the storage medium, reading, processing file system structure and metadata on it; before registering them to the virtual file system (VFS) component. The exact location in VFS that the newly-mouted medium got registered is called mount point (a mount point is a physical location in the partion used as a root filesystem); when the mounting process is completed, the user can access files and directories on the medium from there. An opposite process of mounting is called unmounting, in which the operating system cuts off all user access to files and directories on the mount point, writes the remaining queue of user data to the storage device, refreshes file system metadata, then relinquishes access to the device; making the storage safe for removal. Normally, when the computer is shutting down, every mounted storage will undergo un unmouting process to ensure that all queued data got written, and to preserve integrity of file system structure on the media. Checking Your Available Partitions To see your devices and their separate filesystems, simply use this command: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 0 20G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 0 19.1G 0 part / ├─sda2 8:2 0 1K 0 part └─sda5 8:5 0 880M 0 part [SWAP] sdb 8:16 0 20G 0 disk └─sdb1 8:17 0 20G 0 part /data sdc 8:32 0 20G 0 disk ├─sdc1 8:33 0 1G 0 part /tmp/b ├─sdc2 8:34 0 1G 0 part ├─sdc3 8:35 0 500M 0 part ├─sdc4 8:36 0 1K 0 part ├─sdc5 8:37 0 500M 0 part /tmp/a └─sdc6 8:38 0 10G 0 part Mounting With Udisks Udisks is an important piece of software used in many Linux distributions. It is responsible for managing storage devices such as USB flash storage, and hard disk drives. With it comes a command line tool called udisksctl. Under this tool, all of your partitioning commands follow this pattern: udisksctl [command] Simple isn’t it? To mount your desired partition, use this command, substituting the last bit with the right partition: udisksctl mount -b /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Unmounting With Udisks Once you’re done with your USB, or any other miscellaneous device, you need to safely remove it from your Linux box to prevent data loss. This is done by unmounting the foreign file-system, decoupling it from your own. Doing this is as simple as substituting mount with unmount: udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Mounting the Old-School Way To mount a partition: sudo mount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] /mnt Unmounting the Old-School Way Strangely enough, the command to unmount a partition is not unmount, but umount. Keep that in mind. Unlike mounting, you don’t need to specify the location of your mount point — just the device will do: sudo umount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Update /etc/fstab file to automount partitions at startup Use blkid or lsblk -f to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if disks are added and removed. sudo blkid /dev/sda1: UUID=&quot;b19522be-98e3-4754-af48-14396eae021f&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;2ed9e1c9-01&quot; /dev/sdb1: UUID=&quot;a25ec7d0-0651-4ec8-b888-eeec8d6c2488&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext3&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;c153418e-01&quot; /dev/sda5: UUID=&quot;9ae8f2eb-f27d-4335-a7ee-cda1a2d3e2e0&quot; TYPE=&quot;swap&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;2ed9e1c9-05&quot; /dev/sdc1: UUID=&quot;226e0aaa-66d3-4504-bc84-5f6981670e53&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext2&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-01&quot; /dev/sdc5: UUID=&quot;20b8bb5f-e637-4425-adc1-d586de0c03a3&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-05&quot; /dev/sdc2: UUID=&quot;fc4b7d77-542b-43af-b51c-8633224a4f4c&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-02&quot; /dev/sdc3: UUID=&quot;14de4bde-708c-479b-9e24-dbccb3954f14&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-03&quot; /dev/sdc6: UUID=&quot;293e6f88-ad5b-4f90-b7d2-088b02aab0f8&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-06&quot; Use df -hT -text4 to show all available ext4 filesystems: df -hT -text4 Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 ext4 19G 13G 5.5G 70% / Append a new entry into /etc/fstab: tail -n 1 /etc/fstab UUID=226e0aaa-66d3-4504-bc84-5f6981670e53 /tmp/a ext4 defaults 0 3 Use mount -a to mount all filesystems mentioned in fstab: sudo mount -a df -hT -text4 Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 ext4 19G 13G 5.5G 70% / /dev/sdc1 ext4 1008M 1.3M 956M 1% /tmp/a An example to partion a new disk The follow example create three primary partions and one extended partion with two logical partions: $ fdisk /dev/sdc Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.29.2).

Partitions on these disk can range from 1 to 16 and are also in the /dev directory. For example, /dev/hda4 refers to partion 4 on hard disk a (fist EIDE hard disk). SCSI devices are listed as devices sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde, sdf, and sdg in the /dev directory. Similarly, partions on these disks can range from 1 to 16 and also in the /dev directory. For example, /dev/sda3 refers to partions 3 on SCSI disk a (fisrt SCSI hard disk). Disk formatting Disk formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard disk driver, solid-state driver, floppy disk or USB flash driver for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. The first part ot formatting process that performs basic medium preparation is often referred to as “low-level formatting”. Partioning is the common term for the second part of the process, making the data storage visible to an operating system. The third part of the process, usually termed “high-level formatting” most often refers to the process of generating a new file system. In some operating systems all or parts of these three processes can be combined or repeated at different levels and the term “format” is understood to mean an operation in which a new disk medium is fully prepared to store files. Creating an ext2, or ext3, or ext4, or xfs filesystem Once you’ve partioned your hard disk using fdisk command, use make2fs to create ext2, ext3, ext4 or xfs file system. Create an ext2 file system: mke2fs /dev/sdc1 Create an ext3 file system: mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -j /dev/sda1 Create an ext4 file system: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sda1 Create an xfs file system: mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -t xfs /dev/sda1 Converting ext2 to ext3 For example, if you are upgrading /dev/sda2 that is mounted as /home, from ext2 to ext3, do the following. umount /dev/sda2 tune2fs -j /dev/sda2 mount /dev/sda2 /home Note: You really don’t need to umount and mount it, as ext2 to ext3 conversion can happen on a live file system. But, I feel better doing the conversion offline. Converting ext3 to ext4 If you are upgrading /dev/sda2 that is mounted as /home, from ext3 to ext4, do the following. umount /dev/sda2 tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda2 e2fsck -pf /dev/sda2 mount /dev/sda2 /home Again, try all of the above commands only on a test system, where you can afford to lose all your data. Mount Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and diretories on a storage device (such as hard driver, CD-ROM, or network share) available for user to access via the computer’s file system. In general, the process of mounting comprises operating system acquiring access to the storage medium, reading, processing file system structure and metadata on it; before registering them to the virtual file system (VFS) component. The exact location in VFS that the newly-mouted medium got registered is called mount point (a mount point is a physical location in the partion used as a root filesystem); when the mounting process is completed, the user can access files and directories on the medium from there. An opposite process of mounting is called unmounting, in which the operating system cuts off all user access to files and directories on the mount point, writes the remaining queue of user data to the storage device, refreshes file system metadata, then relinquishes access to the device; making the storage safe for removal. Normally, when the computer is shutting down, every mounted storage will undergo un unmouting process to ensure that all queued data got written, and to preserve integrity of file system structure on the media. Checking Your Available Partitions To see your devices and their separate filesystems, simply use this command: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 0 20G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 0 19.1G 0 part / ├─sda2 8:2 0 1K 0 part └─sda5 8:5 0 880M 0 part [SWAP] sdb 8:16 0 20G 0 disk └─sdb1 8:17 0 20G 0 part /data sdc 8:32 0 20G 0 disk ├─sdc1 8:33 0 1G 0 part /tmp/b ├─sdc2 8:34 0 1G 0 part ├─sdc3 8:35 0 500M 0 part ├─sdc4 8:36 0 1K 0 part ├─sdc5 8:37 0 500M 0 part /tmp/a └─sdc6 8:38 0 10G 0 part Mounting With Udisks Udisks is an important piece of software used in many Linux distributions. It is responsible for managing storage devices such as USB flash storage, and hard disk drives. With it comes a command line tool called udisksctl. Under this tool, all of your partitioning commands follow this pattern: udisksctl [command] Simple isn’t it? To mount your desired partition, use this command, substituting the last bit with the right partition: udisksctl mount -b /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Unmounting With Udisks Once you’re done with your USB, or any other miscellaneous device, you need to safely remove it from your Linux box to prevent data loss. This is done by unmounting the foreign file-system, decoupling it from your own. Doing this is as simple as substituting mount with unmount: udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Mounting the Old-School Way To mount a partition: sudo mount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] /mnt Unmounting the Old-School Way Strangely enough, the command to unmount a partition is not unmount, but umount. Keep that in mind. Unlike mounting, you don’t need to specify the location of your mount point — just the device will do: sudo umount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Update /etc/fstab file to automount partitions at startup Use blkid or lsblk -f to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if disks are added and removed. sudo blkid /dev/sda1: UUID=&quot;b19522be-98e3-4754-af48-14396eae021f&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;2ed9e1c9-01&quot; /dev/sdb1: UUID=&quot;a25ec7d0-0651-4ec8-b888-eeec8d6c2488&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext3&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;c153418e-01&quot; /dev/sda5: UUID=&quot;9ae8f2eb-f27d-4335-a7ee-cda1a2d3e2e0&quot; TYPE=&quot;swap&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;2ed9e1c9-05&quot; /dev/sdc1: UUID=&quot;226e0aaa-66d3-4504-bc84-5f6981670e53&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext2&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-01&quot; /dev/sdc5: UUID=&quot;20b8bb5f-e637-4425-adc1-d586de0c03a3&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-05&quot; /dev/sdc2: UUID=&quot;fc4b7d77-542b-43af-b51c-8633224a4f4c&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-02&quot; /dev/sdc3: UUID=&quot;14de4bde-708c-479b-9e24-dbccb3954f14&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-03&quot; /dev/sdc6: UUID=&quot;293e6f88-ad5b-4f90-b7d2-088b02aab0f8&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-06&quot; Use df -hT -text4 to show all available ext4 filesystems: df -hT -text4 Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 ext4 19G 13G 5.5G 70% / Append a new entry into /etc/fstab: tail -n 1 /etc/fstab UUID=226e0aaa-66d3-4504-bc84-5f6981670e53 /tmp/a ext4 defaults 0 3 Use mount -a to mount all filesystems mentioned in fstab: sudo mount -a df -hT -text4 Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 ext4 19G 13G 5.5G 70% / /dev/sdc1 ext4 1008M 1.3M 956M 1% /tmp/a An example to partion a new disk The follow example create three primary partions and one extended partion with two logical partions: $ fdisk /dev/sdc Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.29.2).

Partioning is typically the fist step of preparing a newly manufactured disk, before any files or directories have been created. The disk stores the information about the partions’ location and sizes in an area known as the partion table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partion then apears in the operating system as a distinct “logical” disk that use part of the actual disk. System administrators use a program called a partion editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. When a hard driver is installed in a computer, it must be partioned before you can format and use it. Partioning a driver is when you divide the total storage of a driver into different pieces. These pieces are call partions. Once a partion is created, it can then be formatted so that it can be used on a computer. Primary, Extended, and Logical Partitions When partitioning, you’ll need to be aware of the difference between primary, extended, and logical partitions. A disk with a traditional partition table can only have up to four partitions. Extended and logical partitions are a way to get around this limitation. Each disk can have up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition. If you need four partitions or less, you can just create them as primary partitions. However, let’s say you want six partitions on a single drive. You’d have to create three primary partitions as well as an extended partition. The extended partition effectively functions as a container that allows you to create a larger amount of logical partitions. So, if you needed six partitions, you’d create three primary partitions, an extended partition, and then three logical partitions inside the extended partition. You could also just create a single primary partition, an extended partition, and five logical partitions — you just can’t have more than four primary partitions at a time. Partition a new disk Use this command lsblk to list available disks: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 0 20G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 0 19.1G 0 part / ├─sda2 8:2 0 1K 0 part └─sda5 8:5 0 880M 0 part [SWAP] sdb 8:16 0 20G 0 disk └─sdb1 8:17 0 20G 0 part /data sdc 8:32 0 20G 0 disk Also you can use command fdisk or lsscsi: fdisk -l|grep &#39;Disk /dev&#39; Disk /dev/sdb: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors Disk /dev/sda: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors Disk /dev/sdc: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors lsscsi [0:0:0:0] disk VMware, VMware Virtual S 1.0 /dev/sda [0:0:1:0] disk VMware, VMware Virtual S 1.0 /dev/sdb [0:0:2:0] disk VMware, VMware Virtual S 1.0 /dev/sdc Use the command fdisk /dev/[sda,sdb, ..., hda, hdb, ...] to partition the new disk: fdisk /dev/sdc The basic fdisk commands you need are: m – print help p – print the partition table n – create a new partition d – delete a partition q – quit without saving changes w – write the new partition table and exit EIDE devices are identifier as hda, hdb, hdc, and hdd in the /dev directory. Partitions on these disk can range from 1 to 16 and are also in the /dev directory. For example, /dev/hda4 refers to partion 4 on hard disk a (fist EIDE hard disk). SCSI devices are listed as devices sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde, sdf, and sdg in the /dev directory. Similarly, partions on these disks can range from 1 to 16 and also in the /dev directory. For example, /dev/sda3 refers to partions 3 on SCSI disk a (fisrt SCSI hard disk). Disk formatting Disk formatting is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard disk driver, solid-state driver, floppy disk or USB flash driver for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. The first part ot formatting process that performs basic medium preparation is often referred to as “low-level formatting”. Partioning is the common term for the second part of the process, making the data storage visible to an operating system. The third part of the process, usually termed “high-level formatting” most often refers to the process of generating a new file system. In some operating systems all or parts of these three processes can be combined or repeated at different levels and the term “format” is understood to mean an operation in which a new disk medium is fully prepared to store files. Creating an ext2, or ext3, or ext4, or xfs filesystem Once you’ve partioned your hard disk using fdisk command, use make2fs to create ext2, ext3, ext4 or xfs file system. Create an ext2 file system: mke2fs /dev/sdc1 Create an ext3 file system: mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -j /dev/sda1 Create an ext4 file system: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sda1 Create an xfs file system: mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1 (or) mke2fs -t xfs /dev/sda1 Converting ext2 to ext3 For example, if you are upgrading /dev/sda2 that is mounted as /home, from ext2 to ext3, do the following. umount /dev/sda2 tune2fs -j /dev/sda2 mount /dev/sda2 /home Note: You really don’t need to umount and mount it, as ext2 to ext3 conversion can happen on a live file system. But, I feel better doing the conversion offline. Converting ext3 to ext4 If you are upgrading /dev/sda2 that is mounted as /home, from ext3 to ext4, do the following. umount /dev/sda2 tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda2 e2fsck -pf /dev/sda2 mount /dev/sda2 /home Again, try all of the above commands only on a test system, where you can afford to lose all your data. Mount Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and diretories on a storage device (such as hard driver, CD-ROM, or network share) available for user to access via the computer’s file system. In general, the process of mounting comprises operating system acquiring access to the storage medium, reading, processing file system structure and metadata on it; before registering them to the virtual file system (VFS) component. The exact location in VFS that the newly-mouted medium got registered is called mount point (a mount point is a physical location in the partion used as a root filesystem); when the mounting process is completed, the user can access files and directories on the medium from there. An opposite process of mounting is called unmounting, in which the operating system cuts off all user access to files and directories on the mount point, writes the remaining queue of user data to the storage device, refreshes file system metadata, then relinquishes access to the device; making the storage safe for removal. Normally, when the computer is shutting down, every mounted storage will undergo un unmouting process to ensure that all queued data got written, and to preserve integrity of file system structure on the media. Checking Your Available Partitions To see your devices and their separate filesystems, simply use this command: lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 0 20G 0 disk ├─sda1 8:1 0 19.1G 0 part / ├─sda2 8:2 0 1K 0 part └─sda5 8:5 0 880M 0 part [SWAP] sdb 8:16 0 20G 0 disk └─sdb1 8:17 0 20G 0 part /data sdc 8:32 0 20G 0 disk ├─sdc1 8:33 0 1G 0 part /tmp/b ├─sdc2 8:34 0 1G 0 part ├─sdc3 8:35 0 500M 0 part ├─sdc4 8:36 0 1K 0 part ├─sdc5 8:37 0 500M 0 part /tmp/a └─sdc6 8:38 0 10G 0 part Mounting With Udisks Udisks is an important piece of software used in many Linux distributions.

Keep that in mind. Unlike mounting, you don’t need to specify the location of your mount point — just the device will do: sudo umount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] Update /etc/fstab file to automount partitions at startup Use blkid or lsblk -f to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if disks are added and removed. sudo blkid /dev/sda1: UUID=&quot;b19522be-98e3-4754-af48-14396eae021f&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;2ed9e1c9-01&quot; /dev/sdb1: UUID=&quot;a25ec7d0-0651-4ec8-b888-eeec8d6c2488&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext3&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;c153418e-01&quot; /dev/sda5: UUID=&quot;9ae8f2eb-f27d-4335-a7ee-cda1a2d3e2e0&quot; TYPE=&quot;swap&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;2ed9e1c9-05&quot; /dev/sdc1: UUID=&quot;226e0aaa-66d3-4504-bc84-5f6981670e53&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext2&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-01&quot; /dev/sdc5: UUID=&quot;20b8bb5f-e637-4425-adc1-d586de0c03a3&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-05&quot; /dev/sdc2: UUID=&quot;fc4b7d77-542b-43af-b51c-8633224a4f4c&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-02&quot; /dev/sdc3: UUID=&quot;14de4bde-708c-479b-9e24-dbccb3954f14&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-03&quot; /dev/sdc6: UUID=&quot;293e6f88-ad5b-4f90-b7d2-088b02aab0f8&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot; PARTUUID=&quot;913e673b-06&quot; Use df -hT -text4 to show all available ext4 filesystems: df -hT -text4 Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 ext4 19G 13G 5.5G 70% / Append a new entry into /etc/fstab: tail -n 1 /etc/fstab UUID=226e0aaa-66d3-4504-bc84-5f6981670e53 /tmp/a ext4 defaults 0 3 Use mount -a to mount all filesystems mentioned in fstab: sudo mount -a df -hT -text4 Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 ext4 19G 13G 5.5G 70% / /dev/sdc1 ext4 1008M 1.3M 956M 1% /tmp/a An example to partion a new disk The follow example create three primary partions and one extended partion with two logical partions: $ fdisk /dev/sdc Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.29.2).

<h2 id="disk-partitioning">Disk partitioning</h2>

<p><strong>Disk partioning</strong> or <strong>disk slicing</strong> is the creation of one or more regions on a hard disk or other secondary storage, so that an operating system can manage information in each region separately. Partioning is typically the fist step of preparing a newly manufactured disk, before any files or directories have been created. The disk stores the information about the partions’ location and sizes in an area known as the <strong>partion table</strong> that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partion then apears in the operating system as a distinct “logical” disk that use part of the actual disk. System administrators use a program called a partion editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. When a hard driver is installed in a computer, it must be partioned before you can format and use it. Partioning a driver is when you divide the total storage of a driver into different pieces. These pieces are call partions. Once a partion is created, it can then be formatted so that it can be used on a computer.</p>

<h3 id="primary-extended-and-logical-partitions">Primary, Extended, and Logical Partitions</h3>

<p>When partitioning, you’ll need to be aware of the difference between primary, extended, and logical partitions. A disk with a traditional partition table can only have up to four partitions. Extended and logical partitions are a way to get around this limitation.</p>

<p>Each disk can have up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition. If you need four partitions or less, you can just create them as primary partitions.</p>

<p>However, let’s say you want six partitions on a single drive. You’d have to create three primary partitions as well as an extended partition. The extended partition effectively functions as a container that allows you to create a larger amount of logical partitions. So, if you needed six partitions, you’d create three primary partitions, an extended partition, and then three logical partitions inside the extended partition. You could also just create a single primary partition, an extended partition, and five logical partitions — you just can’t have more than four primary partitions at a time.</p>

<h3 id="partition-a-new-disk">Partition a new disk</h3>

<p>Use this command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsblk</code> to list available disks:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lsblk

<p>Also you can use command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fdisk</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsscsi</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fdisk -l|grep 'Disk /dev'

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fdisk /dev/[sda,sdb, ..., hda, hdb, ...]</code> to partition the new disk:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fdisk /dev/sdc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The basic fdisk commands you need are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>m</strong> – print help</li>
  <li><strong>p</strong> – print the partition table</li>
  <li><strong>n</strong> – create a new partition</li>
  <li><strong>d</strong> – delete a partition</li>
  <li><strong>q</strong> – quit without saving changes</li>
  <li><strong>w</strong> – write the new partition table and exit</li>
</ul>

<p>EIDE devices are identifier as <em>hda</em>, <em>hdb</em>, <em>hdc</em>, and <em>hdd</em> in the <em>/dev</em> directory. Partitions on these disk can range from 1 to 16 and are also in the <em>/dev</em> directory. For example, <em>/dev/hda4</em> refers to partion 4 on hard disk a (fist EIDE hard disk).</p>

<p>SCSI devices are listed as devices <em>sda</em>, <em>sdb</em>, <em>sdc</em>, <em>sdd</em>, <em>sde</em>, <em>sdf</em>, and <em>sdg</em> in the <em>/dev</em> directory. Similarly, partions on these disks can range from 1 to 16 and also in the <em>/dev</em> directory. For example, <em>/dev/sda3</em> refers to partions 3 on SCSI disk a (fisrt SCSI hard disk).</p>

<h2 id="disk-formatting">Disk formatting</h2>

<p><strong>Disk formatting</strong> is the process of preparing a data storage device such as a hard disk driver, solid-state driver, floppy disk or USB flash driver for initial use. In some cases, the formatting operation may also create one or more new file systems. The first part ot formatting process that performs basic medium preparation is often referred to as “low-level formatting”. Partioning is the common term for the second part of the process, making the data storage visible to an operating system. The third part of the process, usually termed “high-level formatting” most often refers to the process of generating a new file system. In some operating systems all or parts of these three processes can be combined or repeated at different levels and the term “format” is understood to mean an operation in which a new disk medium is fully prepared to store files.</p>

<h3 id="creating-an-ext2-or-ext3-or-ext4-or-xfs-filesystem">Creating an ext2, or ext3, or ext4, or xfs filesystem</h3>

<p>Once you’ve partioned your hard disk using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fdisk</code> command, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make2fs</code> to create <em>ext2</em>, <em>ext3</em>, <em>ext4</em> or <em>xfs</em> file system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create an ext2 file system:</p>

<h4 id="converting-ext2-to-ext3">Converting ext2 to ext3</h4>

<p>For example, if you are upgrading <em>/dev/sda2</em> that is mounted as <em>/home</em>, from ext2 to ext3, do the following.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>umount /dev/sda2

tune2fs <span class="nt">-j</span> /dev/sda2

mount /dev/sda2 /home
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: You really don’t need to umount and mount it, as ext2 to ext3 conversion can happen on a live file system. But, I feel better doing the conversion offline.</p>

<h4 id="converting-ext3-to-ext4">Converting ext3 to ext4</h4>

<p>If you are upgrading <em>/dev/sda2</em> that is mounted as <em>/home</em>, from ext3 to ext4, do the following.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>umount /dev/sda2

tune2fs <span class="nt">-O</span> extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda2

e2fsck <span class="nt">-pf</span> /dev/sda2

mount /dev/sda2 /home
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, try all of the above commands only on a test system, where you can afford to lose all your data.</p>

<h2 id="mount">Mount</h2>

<p><strong>Mounting</strong> is a process by which the operating system makes files and diretories on a storage device (such as hard driver, CD-ROM, or network share) available for user to access via the computer’s file system.</p>

<p>In general, the process of mounting comprises operating system acquiring access to the storage medium, reading, processing file system structure and metadata on it; before registering them to the virtual file system (VFS) component.</p>

<p>The exact location in VFS that the newly-mouted medium got registered is called <strong>mount point</strong> (a mount point is a physical location in the partion used as a root filesystem); when the mounting process is completed, the user can access files and directories on the medium from there.</p>

<p>An opposite process of mounting is called <strong>unmounting</strong>, in which the operating system cuts off all user access to files and directories on the mount point, writes the remaining queue of user data to the storage device, refreshes file system metadata, then relinquishes access to the device; making the storage safe for removal.</p>

<p>Normally, when the computer is shutting down, every mounted storage will undergo un unmouting process to ensure that all queued data got written, and to preserve integrity of file system structure on the media.</p>

<h3 id="mounting-with-udisks">Mounting With Udisks</h3>

<p>Udisks is an important piece of software used in many Linux distributions. It is responsible for managing storage devices such as USB flash storage, and hard disk drives. With it comes a command line tool called udisksctl. Under this tool, all of your partitioning commands follow this pattern:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>udisksctl <span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">command</span><span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simple isn’t it? To mount your desired partition, use this command, substituting the last bit with the right partition:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>udisksctl mount <span class="nt">-b</span> /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="unmounting-with-udisks">Unmounting With Udisks</h3>

<p>Once you’re done with your USB, or any other miscellaneous device, you need to safely remove it from your Linux box to prevent data loss. This is done by unmounting the foreign file-system, decoupling it from your own.</p>

<p>Doing this is as simple as substituting <em>mount</em> with <em>unmount</em>:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>udisksctl unmount <span class="nt">-b</span> /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="mounting-the-old-school-way">Mounting the Old-School Way</h3>

<p>To mount a partition:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>mount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.] /mnt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="unmounting-the-old-school-way">Unmounting the Old-School Way</h3>

<p>Strangely enough, the command to unmount a partition is not unmount, but umount. Keep that in mind. Unlike mounting, you don’t need to specify the location of your mount point — just the device will do:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>umount /dev/sd[b1, b2, etc.]
