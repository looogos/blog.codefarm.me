<meta name="description" content="Defining Simple Methods # Define a method named &#39;factorial&#39; with a single parameter &#39;n&#39; def factorial(n) if n &lt; 1 # Test the argument value for validity raise &quot;argument must be &gt; 0&quot; elsif n == 1 # If the argument is 1 1 # then the value of the method invocation is 1 else # Otherwise, the factorial of n is n times n * factorial(n-1) # the factorial of n-1 end end Method Return Value If a method terminates normally, then the value of the method invocation expression is the value of the last expression evaluated within the method. return The keyword return is used to force a return prior to the end of the method. If an expression follows the return keyword, then the value of that expression is returned. If no expression follows, then the return value is nil. Invoking a Method on an Object Methods are always invoked on an object. Within the body of a method, the keyword self refers to the object on which the method was invoked. If we don’t specify an object when invoking a method, then the method is implicitly invoked on self. Defining Singleton Methods global functions, instance methods, module methods, class methods It is also possible to use def statement to define a singleton method that is avaiable only on a single object. The expression to define a singleton method should be followed by a period and the name of the method to be defined. o = &quot;message&quot; # A string is an object def o.printme # Define a singleton method for this object puts self end o.printme # Invoke the singleton *Ruby implementations typically treat Fixnum and Symbol values as immediate values rather than as true object references. For this reason, singleton methods may not be defined on Fixnum and Symbol objects. For consistency, singletons are also prohibited on other Numeric objects.* Undefing Method Methods are defined with the def statement and may be undefined with the undef statement. def sum(x,y); x+y; end # Define a method puts sum(1,2) # Use it undef sum # And undefine it Interestingly, undef can be used to undefine inherited methods, without affecting the definition of the method in the class from which it is inherited. undef cannot be used to undefine a singleton method. Within a class or module, you can also use undef_method (a private method of Module) to undefine methods. Method Names By convention, method names begin with a lowercase letter. When a method name is longer than one word, the usual convention is to separate the words with underscores like_this rather than using mixed case likeThis. =,?,! Method names may (but are not required to) end with an equals sign, a question mark, or an exclamation point. setter An equals sign suffix signifies that the method is a setter that can be invoked using assignment syntax. predicates Any method whose name ends with a question mark are called predicates returns one the Boolean value true or false, but not required, as any value other than false or nil works like true when a Boolean value is required that answers the question posed by the method invocation. mutators Any method whose name ends with an exclamation mark should be used with caution. Often, methods that end with an exclamation mark are mutators, which alter the internal state of an object. Operator Methods Many of Ruby’s operators, sucn as +,*, and even the array operator [], are implemented with methods that you can define in your own classes. Method Aliases The keyword alias serves to define a new name for an existing method. alias aka also_known_as # alias new_name existing_name Aliasing is not overloading. def hello # A nice simple method puts &quot;Hello World&quot; # Suppose we want to augment it... end alias original_hello hello # Give the method a backup name def hello # Now we define a new method with the old name puts &quot;Your attention please&quot; # That does some stuff original_hello # Then calls the original method puts &quot;This has been a test&quot; # Then does some more stuff end Methods and Parentheses Ruby allows parentheses to be omitted from most method invocation. puts &quot;Hello World&quot; puts(&quot;Hello World&quot;) greeting = &quot;Hello&quot; size = greeting.length size = greeting.length() x = 3 x.between? 1,5 x.between?(1,5) f g x, y # f((g(x),y) not f(g(x,y)) !!! square(2+2)*2 # square(4)*2 = 16*2 = 32 square (2+2)*2 # square(4*2) = square(8) = 64 Method Arguments Parameter Defaults Specify a default value by following the parameter name with an equals sign and a value: def prefix(s,len=1) s[0,len] end Argument defaults need not be constants: they may be arbitrary expressions, and can be referred to instance variable and previous parameter in the parameter list. # Return the last character of s or the substring from index to the end def suffix(s, index=s.size-1) s[index, s.size-index) end Parameter defaults are evaluated when a method is invoked rather than when it is parsed. Variable-Length Argument Lists and Arrays # Return the largest of the one or more arugments passed def max(first, *rest) # Assume that the required first argument is the largest max = first # Now loop through each of the optional arguments looking for bigger ones rest.each {|x| max = x if x &gt; max } # Return the largest one we found max end No more than one parameter may be prefixed with an * and it should be the last parameter of the method, unless the method also has a parameter with an &amp; prefix. max(1) # first=1, rest=[] max(1,2) # first=1, rest=[2] max(1,2,3) # first=1, rest=[2,3] Passing arrays to methods * can also be used in a method invocation to scatter, expand, or explode the elements of an array (or range or emuerator) so that each element becomes a separate method argument. data = [3,2,1] m = max(*data) # first=3, rest=[2,1] =&gt; 3 Mapping Arguments to Parameters A little bit triky To be continued… Hashes for Named Arguments When a method requires more than two or three arguments, it can be difficult for the programmer invoking the method to remember the proper order for those argments. Ruby does not support to write method invocations that explicitly specify a parameter name for each arugment that is passed, but it can approximated if you write a method that expects a hash as its argument or as one of its arguments. # This method returns an array a of n numbers. For any index i, 0 &lt;= i &lt; n, # the value of element a[i] is m*i+c. Arguments n, m, and c are passed # as keys in a hash, so that it is not necessary to remember their order. def sequence(args) # Extract the arguments from the hash. # Note the use of the || operator to specify defaults used # if the hash does not define a key that we are interested in. n = args[:n] || 0 m = args[:m] || 1 c = args[:c] || 0 a = [] # Start with an empty array n.times {|i| a &lt;&lt; m*i+c } # Calculate the value of each array element a # Return the array end You might invoke this method with a hash literal argument like this: sequence({:n=&gt;3, :m=&gt;5}) # =&gt; [0, 5, 10] In order to better support this style of programming, Ruby allows you to omit the curly braces around the hash literal if it is the last argument to the method (or if the only arugment that follows it is a block argument, prefixed with &amp;). A hash without braces is sometinmes called a bare hash. sequence(:m=&gt;3, :n=&gt;5) # =&gt; [0, 3, 6, 9, 12] As with other ruby methods, we can omit the parentheses. sequence c:1, m:3, n:5 # =&gt; [1, 4, 7, 10, 13] If you omit the paretheses, then you must omit the curly braces. # Ruby thinks you&#39;re passing a block to the method. seqence {:m=&gt;3, :n=&gt;5 } # Syntax error! Block Arguments Any mehtod invocation may be followed by a block, and any method that has a block associated with it may invoke the code in that block with the yield statement. # Generate a sequence of n numbers m*i + c and pass them to the block def sequence2(n, m, c) i = 0 while(i &lt; n) # loop n times yield i*m + c # pass next element of the sequence to the block i += 1 end end # Here is how you might use this verison of the method sequence2(5, 2, 2) { |x| puts x } # Print numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 One of the features of blocks is their anonymity. If you prefer more explicit control over a block, add a final argument to your method, and prefix the argument name with an ampersand. The value of the argument will be a Proc object, and instead of using yield, you invoke the call method of the Proc. def sequence3(n, m, c, &amp;p) # Explicit argument to get block as a Proc i = 0 while(i &lt; n) b.call(i*m + c) # Invoke the Proc with its call method i += 1 end end # Note that the block is still passed outside of the parentheses sequence3(5, 2, 2) { |x| puts x } Notice that using the ampersand in this way changes only the method definition. Passing Proc Objects Explicityly # This version expects an explicitly-created Proc object, not a block def sequence4(n, m, c, b) # No ampersand used for arguemnt b i = 0 while(i &lt; n) b.call(i*m + c) # Proc is called explicitly i += 1 end end p = Proc.new { |x| puts x } # Explicity create a Proc object sequence4(5, 2, 2, p) # And pass it as an ordinary argument Block arguments prefixed with ampersands must really the last one in the parameter list. def sequence5(args, &amp;b) # Pass arguments as a hash and follow with a block n, m, c = argus[:n], args[:m], args[:c] i = 0 while(i &lt; n) b.call(i*m + c) i += 1 end end # Expects one or more arguments, followed by a block def max(first, *rest, &amp;block) max = first rest.each { |x| max = x if x &gt; max } block.call(max) max end The yield satement still works in a method defined with an &amp; parameter. Even if the block has been converted to a Proc object and passed as an argument, it can still be invoked as an anonymous block, as if the block argument was not there. Using &amp; in method invocation * in a method definition to specify that multiple arguments should be packed into an array * in a method invocaiton to specify that an array should be upcaked so that its elements become separate arguments &amp; in a method definition allows an ordinary block associated with a method invocation to be used as a named Proc object inside the method. &amp; in a method invocation that before a Proc object to treat the Proc as if it was an ordinary block following the invocation. In a mehtod invocation an &amp; typically appears before a Proc object. But it is accually allowed before any object with a to_proc method (e.g Method and Symbol classes). a, b = [1,2,3], [4,5] # Start with some data. summation = Proc.new { |total,x| total+x } # A Proc object for summations sum = a.inject(0, &amp;summation) # =&gt; 6 sum = b.inject(0, &amp;summation) # =&gt; 15 Procs and Lambdas Blocks are syntactic structures in Ruby; they are not objects, and cannot be manipulated as objects. Procs have block-like behavior and lambdas have method-like behavior, however, both are instances of class Proc. Creating Procs Proc factory method # This method creates a proc from a block def make_proc(&amp;p) # Convert associated block to a Proc and store in p p # Return the Proc object end adder = make_proc { |x,y| x+y } sum = adder.call(2,2) # =&gt; 4 Proc.new p = Proc.new { |x,y| x+y } Kernel.lambda is_positive = lambda { |x| x &gt; 0 } Kernel.proc proc is a synonym for Proc.new. Lambda Literals In Ruby 1.8 succ = lambda { |x| x+1 } In Ruby 1.9, we can convert this to a literal as follows: Replace the method name lambda with the punctuation -&gt;. Move the list of arguments outside of and just before the curly braces. Change the argument list delimiters from || to (). succ = -&gt;(x){ x+1 } A lambda literal uses an arrow made with a hypen, whereas a hash literal uses an arrow made with an equals sign. # This lambada takes 2 args and declares 3 local vars f = -&gt;(x,y; i,j,k) { ... } Lambdas can be to declared with argument defaults. zoom = -&gt;(x,y,factor=2) { [x*factor, y*factor] } As with method declarations, the parentheses in lambda literals are optional, because the parameter list and localvariable lists are completely delimited by the -&gt;,;, and {. succ = -&gt; { x + 1 } f = -&gt; x,y; i,j,k { ... } zoom = -&gt; x,y,factor=2 { x*factor, y*factor } Lambda parameters and local variables are optional. -&gt; {} If you want to pass a lambda literal to a method that expects a block, prefix the literal with &amp;. data.sort { |a,b| b-a } # The block version data.sort &amp;-&gt;a,b{ b-a } # The lambda literal version Invoking Procs and Lambdas Procs and lambdas are objects, not methods, and they cannot be invoked in the same way that method are. f = Proc.new { |x,y| 1.0/(1.0/x + 1.0/y) } z = f.call(x,y) The Proc class also defines the array access operator to work the same as call. z = f[x,y] An alternative to square brackets, you can use parentheses prefixed with a period. z = f.(x,y) .() is a syntactic-sugar that invokes the call method, and can be used with any object that defines a call method and is not limited to Proc objects. How Lambdas Differ from Procs A proc is the object form of a block, and it behaves like a block. A lambda has slightly modified behavior and behaves more like a method than a block. Calling a proc is like yielding to a block, whereas calling a lambda is like invoking a mehtod. In Ruby 1.9, you can determine whether a Proc object is a proc or a lambda with the instance method lambda?. Return in blocks, procs, and lambdas The return statement in a block does not just return from the block to the invoking iterator, it reutrns from the mehtod that invoked the iterator. def test puts &quot;entering method&quot; 1.times { puts &quot;entering block&quot;; return } # Makes test method return puts &quot;exiting method&quot; # This line is never executed end A proc is like a block, so if you call a proc that executes a return statement, it attempts to return from the method that encloses the block that was converted to the proc. def test puts &quot;entering method&quot; p = Proc.new { puts &quot;entering proc&quot;; return } p.call # Invoking the proc makes method return puts &quot;exiting method&quot; # This line is never executed. end Using a return statement in a proc is triky. (LocalJumpError) A return statement in a lambda, therefore, returns from the lambda itself, not from the method that surrounds the creation site of the lambda. def test puts &quot;entering method&quot; p = lambda { puts &quot;entering lambda&quot;; return } p.call # Invoking the lambda does not make the method return puts &quot;exiting method&quot; # This line *is* executed now end Closures In Ruby, procs and lambdas are closures. The term “closure” comes from the early days of computer science; it refers to an object that is both an invocable funciton and a varible binding for that funciton. When you create a proc or a labmda, the resulting Proc object holds not just the executable block but also bindings for all the varialbes used by the block. Closures and Shared Variables It is important to understand that a closure does not just retain the value of the variables it refers to—it retains the actual variables and extends their lifetime. The bindings are dynamic, and the values of the variables are looked up when the lambda or proc is executed. As an example, the following code defines a method that returns two lambdas. Because the lambdas are defined in the same scope, they share access to the variables in that scope. When on lamda alters the values of a shared varible, the new value is available to the other lambda. # Return a pair of lambdas that share access to a local variable. def accessor_pair(initial_value=nil) value = intiial_value # A local variable shared by the returned lambdas getter = lambda { value } # Return value of local variable setter = lambda { |x| value = x } # Change value of local variable return getter, setter end getX, setX = accessor_pair(0) # Create accssor lambdas for initial value 0. puts getX[] # Prints 0. Note square brackets instead of call. set[10] # Change the value through one closure. puts getX[] # Prints 10. The change is visible through the other. Closures and Bindings The Proc class define a method named binding. Calling this method on a proc or lambda returns a Binding object that represents the bindings in effect for that closure. A Binding object doesn’t have interesting methods of it own, but it can be used as the second argument to the global eval fuction`, providing a context in which to evaluate a string of Ruby code. In Ruby 1.9, Binding has its own eval method. The use of a Binding object and the eval method gives us a back door through which we can manipulate the behavior of a closure. # Return a lambda that retains or &quot;closes over&quot; the argument n def mulitplier(n) lambda { |data| data.collect{ |x| x*n } } end doubler = multiplier(2) # Get a lambda that knows how to double puts doubler.call([1,2,3]) # Prints 2,4,6 eval(&quot;n=3&quot;, doubler.binding) # Or doubler.binding.eval(&quot;n=3&quot;) in Ruby 1.9 puts doubler.call([1,2,3]) # Now this pritns 3,6,9! Bindings are not only a feature of closures. The Kernel.binding method returns a Binding object that represents the bindings in effect at whatever point you happen to call it. Method Object Ruby’s methods and blocks are executable language constructs, but they are not objects. Procs and lambdas are object versions of blocks; they can be executed and also manipualted as data. Ruby has powerful metaprogramming (or refleciton) capabilities, and methods can actually be represented as instance of the Method class. Functional Programming Ruby is not a functional programming language in the way that languages like Lisp and Haskell are, but Ruby’s blocks, procs, and lambdas lend themselves nicely to a funcitonal programming style.

Change the argument list delimiters from || to (). succ = -&gt;(x){ x+1 } A lambda literal uses an arrow made with a hypen, whereas a hash literal uses an arrow made with an equals sign. # This lambada takes 2 args and declares 3 local vars f = -&gt;(x,y; i,j,k) { ... } Lambdas can be to declared with argument defaults. zoom = -&gt;(x,y,factor=2) { [x*factor, y*factor] } As with method declarations, the parentheses in lambda literals are optional, because the parameter list and localvariable lists are completely delimited by the -&gt;,;, and {. succ = -&gt; { x + 1 } f = -&gt; x,y; i,j,k { ... } zoom = -&gt; x,y,factor=2 { x*factor, y*factor } Lambda parameters and local variables are optional. -&gt; {} If you want to pass a lambda literal to a method that expects a block, prefix the literal with &amp;. data.sort { |a,b| b-a } # The block version data.sort &amp;-&gt;a,b{ b-a } # The lambda literal version Invoking Procs and Lambdas Procs and lambdas are objects, not methods, and they cannot be invoked in the same way that method are. f = Proc.new { |x,y| 1.0/(1.0/x + 1.0/y) } z = f.call(x,y) The Proc class also defines the array access operator to work the same as call. z = f[x,y] An alternative to square brackets, you can use parentheses prefixed with a period. z = f.(x,y) .() is a syntactic-sugar that invokes the call method, and can be used with any object that defines a call method and is not limited to Proc objects. How Lambdas Differ from Procs A proc is the object form of a block, and it behaves like a block. A lambda has slightly modified behavior and behaves more like a method than a block. Calling a proc is like yielding to a block, whereas calling a lambda is like invoking a mehtod. In Ruby 1.9, you can determine whether a Proc object is a proc or a lambda with the instance method lambda?. Return in blocks, procs, and lambdas The return statement in a block does not just return from the block to the invoking iterator, it reutrns from the mehtod that invoked the iterator. def test puts &quot;entering method&quot; 1.times { puts &quot;entering block&quot;; return } # Makes test method return puts &quot;exiting method&quot; # This line is never executed end A proc is like a block, so if you call a proc that executes a return statement, it attempts to return from the method that encloses the block that was converted to the proc. def test puts &quot;entering method&quot; p = Proc.new { puts &quot;entering proc&quot;; return } p.call # Invoking the proc makes method return puts &quot;exiting method&quot; # This line is never executed. end Using a return statement in a proc is triky. (LocalJumpError) A return statement in a lambda, therefore, returns from the lambda itself, not from the method that surrounds the creation site of the lambda. def test puts &quot;entering method&quot; p = lambda { puts &quot;entering lambda&quot;; return } p.call # Invoking the lambda does not make the method return puts &quot;exiting method&quot; # This line *is* executed now end Closures In Ruby, procs and lambdas are closures. The term “closure” comes from the early days of computer science; it refers to an object that is both an invocable funciton and a varible binding for that funciton. When you create a proc or a labmda, the resulting Proc object holds not just the executable block but also bindings for all the varialbes used by the block. Closures and Shared Variables It is important to understand that a closure does not just retain the value of the variables it refers to—it retains the actual variables and extends their lifetime. The bindings are dynamic, and the values of the variables are looked up when the lambda or proc is executed. As an example, the following code defines a method that returns two lambdas. Because the lambdas are defined in the same scope, they share access to the variables in that scope. When on lamda alters the values of a shared varible, the new value is available to the other lambda. # Return a pair of lambdas that share access to a local variable. def accessor_pair(initial_value=nil) value = intiial_value # A local variable shared by the returned lambdas getter = lambda { value } # Return value of local variable setter = lambda { |x| value = x } # Change value of local variable return getter, setter end getX, setX = accessor_pair(0) # Create accssor lambdas for initial value 0. puts getX[] # Prints 0. Note square brackets instead of call. set[10] # Change the value through one closure. puts getX[] # Prints 10. The change is visible through the other. Closures and Bindings The Proc class define a method named binding. Calling this method on a proc or lambda returns a Binding object that represents the bindings in effect for that closure. A Binding object doesn’t have interesting methods of it own, but it can be used as the second argument to the global eval fuction`, providing a context in which to evaluate a string of Ruby code. In Ruby 1.9, Binding has its own eval method. The use of a Binding object and the eval method gives us a back door through which we can manipulate the behavior of a closure. # Return a lambda that retains or &quot;closes over&quot; the argument n def mulitplier(n) lambda { |data| data.collect{ |x| x*n } } end doubler = multiplier(2) # Get a lambda that knows how to double puts doubler.call([1,2,3]) # Prints 2,4,6 eval(&quot;n=3&quot;, doubler.binding) # Or doubler.binding.eval(&quot;n=3&quot;) in Ruby 1.9 puts doubler.call([1,2,3]) # Now this pritns 3,6,9! Bindings are not only a feature of closures. The Kernel.binding method returns a Binding object that represents the bindings in effect at whatever point you happen to call it. Method Object Ruby’s methods and blocks are executable language constructs, but they are not objects. Procs and lambdas are object versions of blocks; they can be executed and also manipualted as data. Ruby has powerful metaprogramming (or refleciton) capabilities, and methods can actually be represented as instance of the Method class. Functional Programming Ruby is not a functional programming language in the way that languages like Lisp and Haskell are, but Ruby’s blocks, procs, and lambdas lend themselves nicely to a funcitonal programming style.

If an expression follows the return keyword, then the value of that expression is returned. If no expression follows, then the return value is nil. Invoking a Method on an Object Methods are always invoked on an object. Within the body of a method, the keyword self refers to the object on which the method was invoked. If we don’t specify an object when invoking a method, then the method is implicitly invoked on self. Defining Singleton Methods global functions, instance methods, module methods, class methods It is also possible to use def statement to define a singleton method that is avaiable only on a single object. The expression to define a singleton method should be followed by a period and the name of the method to be defined. o = &quot;message&quot; # A string is an object def o.printme # Define a singleton method for this object puts self end o.printme # Invoke the singleton *Ruby implementations typically treat Fixnum and Symbol values as immediate values rather than as true object references. For this reason, singleton methods may not be defined on Fixnum and Symbol objects. For consistency, singletons are also prohibited on other Numeric objects.* Undefing Method Methods are defined with the def statement and may be undefined with the undef statement. def sum(x,y); x+y; end # Define a method puts sum(1,2) # Use it undef sum # And undefine it Interestingly, undef can be used to undefine inherited methods, without affecting the definition of the method in the class from which it is inherited. undef cannot be used to undefine a singleton method. Within a class or module, you can also use undef_method (a private method of Module) to undefine methods. Method Names By convention, method names begin with a lowercase letter. When a method name is longer than one word, the usual convention is to separate the words with underscores like_this rather than using mixed case likeThis. =,?,! Method names may (but are not required to) end with an equals sign, a question mark, or an exclamation point. setter An equals sign suffix signifies that the method is a setter that can be invoked using assignment syntax. predicates Any method whose name ends with a question mark are called predicates returns one the Boolean value true or false, but not required, as any value other than false or nil works like true when a Boolean value is required that answers the question posed by the method invocation. mutators Any method whose name ends with an exclamation mark should be used with caution. Often, methods that end with an exclamation mark are mutators, which alter the internal state of an object. Operator Methods Many of Ruby’s operators, sucn as +,*, and even the array operator [], are implemented with methods that you can define in your own classes. Method Aliases The keyword alias serves to define a new name for an existing method. alias aka also_known_as # alias new_name existing_name Aliasing is not overloading. def hello # A nice simple method puts &quot;Hello World&quot; # Suppose we want to augment it... end alias original_hello hello # Give the method a backup name def hello # Now we define a new method with the old name puts &quot;Your attention please&quot; # That does some stuff original_hello # Then calls the original method puts &quot;This has been a test&quot; # Then does some more stuff end Methods and Parentheses Ruby allows parentheses to be omitted from most method invocation. puts &quot;Hello World&quot; puts(&quot;Hello World&quot;) greeting = &quot;Hello&quot; size = greeting.length size = greeting.length() x = 3 x.between? 1,5 x.between?(1,5) f g x, y # f((g(x),y) not f(g(x,y)) !!! square(2+2)*2 # square(4)*2 = 16*2 = 32 square (2+2)*2 # square(4*2) = square(8) = 64 Method Arguments Parameter Defaults Specify a default value by following the parameter name with an equals sign and a value: def prefix(s,len=1) s[0,len] end Argument defaults need not be constants: they may be arbitrary expressions, and can be referred to instance variable and previous parameter in the parameter list. # Return the last character of s or the substring from index to the end def suffix(s, index=s.size-1) s[index, s.size-index) end Parameter defaults are evaluated when a method is invoked rather than when it is parsed. Variable-Length Argument Lists and Arrays # Return the largest of the one or more arugments passed def max(first, *rest) # Assume that the required first argument is the largest max = first # Now loop through each of the optional arguments looking for bigger ones rest.each {|x| max = x if x &gt; max } # Return the largest one we found max end No more than one parameter may be prefixed with an * and it should be the last parameter of the method, unless the method also has a parameter with an &amp; prefix. max(1) # first=1, rest=[] max(1,2) # first=1, rest=[2] max(1,2,3) # first=1, rest=[2,3] Passing arrays to methods * can also be used in a method invocation to scatter, expand, or explode the elements of an array (or range or emuerator) so that each element becomes a separate method argument. data = [3,2,1] m = max(*data) # first=3, rest=[2,1] =&gt; 3 Mapping Arguments to Parameters A little bit triky To be continued… Hashes for Named Arguments When a method requires more than two or three arguments, it can be difficult for the programmer invoking the method to remember the proper order for those argments. Ruby does not support to write method invocations that explicitly specify a parameter name for each arugment that is passed, but it can approximated if you write a method that expects a hash as its argument or as one of its arguments. # This method returns an array a of n numbers. For any index i, 0 &lt;= i &lt; n, # the value of element a[i] is m*i+c. Arguments n, m, and c are passed # as keys in a hash, so that it is not necessary to remember their order. def sequence(args) # Extract the arguments from the hash. # Note the use of the || operator to specify defaults used # if the hash does not define a key that we are interested in. n = args[:n] || 0 m = args[:m] || 1 c = args[:c] || 0 a = [] # Start with an empty array n.times {|i| a &lt;&lt; m*i+c } # Calculate the value of each array element a # Return the array end You might invoke this method with a hash literal argument like this: sequence({:n=&gt;3, :m=&gt;5}) # =&gt; [0, 5, 10] In order to better support this style of programming, Ruby allows you to omit the curly braces around the hash literal if it is the last argument to the method (or if the only arugment that follows it is a block argument, prefixed with &amp;). A hash without braces is sometinmes called a bare hash. sequence(:m=&gt;3, :n=&gt;5) # =&gt; [0, 3, 6, 9, 12] As with other ruby methods, we can omit the parentheses. sequence c:1, m:3, n:5 # =&gt; [1, 4, 7, 10, 13] If you omit the paretheses, then you must omit the curly braces. # Ruby thinks you&#39;re passing a block to the method. seqence {:m=&gt;3, :n=&gt;5 } # Syntax error! Block Arguments Any mehtod invocation may be followed by a block, and any method that has a block associated with it may invoke the code in that block with the yield statement. # Generate a sequence of n numbers m*i + c and pass them to the block def sequence2(n, m, c) i = 0 while(i &lt; n) # loop n times yield i*m + c # pass next element of the sequence to the block i += 1 end end # Here is how you might use this verison of the method sequence2(5, 2, 2) { |x| puts x } # Print numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 One of the features of blocks is their anonymity. If you prefer more explicit control over a block, add a final argument to your method, and prefix the argument name with an ampersand. The value of the argument will be a Proc object, and instead of using yield, you invoke the call method of the Proc. def sequence3(n, m, c, &amp;p) # Explicit argument to get block as a Proc i = 0 while(i &lt; n) b.call(i*m + c) # Invoke the Proc with its call method i += 1 end end # Note that the block is still passed outside of the parentheses sequence3(5, 2, 2) { |x| puts x } Notice that using the ampersand in this way changes only the method definition. Passing Proc Objects Explicityly # This version expects an explicitly-created Proc object, not a block def sequence4(n, m, c, b) # No ampersand used for arguemnt b i = 0 while(i &lt; n) b.call(i*m + c) # Proc is called explicitly i += 1 end end p = Proc.new { |x| puts x } # Explicity create a Proc object sequence4(5, 2, 2, p) # And pass it as an ordinary argument Block arguments prefixed with ampersands must really the last one in the parameter list. def sequence5(args, &amp;b) # Pass arguments as a hash and follow with a block n, m, c = argus[:n], args[:m], args[:c] i = 0 while(i &lt; n) b.call(i*m + c) i += 1 end end # Expects one or more arguments, followed by a block def max(first, *rest, &amp;block) max = first rest.each { |x| max = x if x &gt; max } block.call(max) max end The yield satement still works in a method defined with an &amp; parameter. Even if the block has been converted to a Proc object and passed as an argument, it can still be invoked as an anonymous block, as if the block argument was not there. Using &amp; in method invocation * in a method definition to specify that multiple arguments should be packed into an array * in a method invocaiton to specify that an array should be upcaked so that its elements become separate arguments &amp; in a method definition allows an ordinary block associated with a method invocation to be used as a named Proc object inside the method. &amp; in a method invocation that before a Proc object to treat the Proc as if it was an ordinary block following the invocation. In a mehtod invocation an &amp; typically appears before a Proc object. But it is accually allowed before any object with a to_proc method (e.g Method and Symbol classes). a, b = [1,2,3], [4,5] # Start with some data. summation = Proc.new { |total,x| total+x } # A Proc object for summations sum = a.inject(0, &amp;summation) # =&gt; 6 sum = b.inject(0, &amp;summation) # =&gt; 15 Procs and Lambdas Blocks are syntactic structures in Ruby; they are not objects, and cannot be manipulated as objects. Procs have block-like behavior and lambdas have method-like behavior, however, both are instances of class Proc. Creating Procs Proc factory method # This method creates a proc from a block def make_proc(&amp;p) # Convert associated block to a Proc and store in p p # Return the Proc object end adder = make_proc { |x,y| x+y } sum = adder.call(2,2) # =&gt; 4 Proc.new p = Proc.new { |x,y| x+y } Kernel.lambda is_positive = lambda { |x| x &gt; 0 } Kernel.proc proc is a synonym for Proc.new. Lambda Literals In Ruby 1.8 succ = lambda { |x| x+1 } In Ruby 1.9, we can convert this to a literal as follows: Replace the method name lambda with the punctuation -&gt;. Move the list of arguments outside of and just before the curly braces. Change the argument list delimiters from || to (). succ = -&gt;(x){ x+1 } A lambda literal uses an arrow made with a hypen, whereas a hash literal uses an arrow made with an equals sign. # This lambada takes 2 args and declares 3 local vars f = -&gt;(x,y; i,j,k) { ... } Lambdas can be to declared with argument defaults. zoom = -&gt;(x,y,factor=2) { [x*factor, y*factor] } As with method declarations, the parentheses in lambda literals are optional, because the parameter list and localvariable lists are completely delimited by the -&gt;,;, and {. succ = -&gt; { x + 1 } f = -&gt; x,y; i,j,k { ... } zoom = -&gt; x,y,factor=2 { x*factor, y*factor } Lambda parameters and local variables are optional. -&gt; {} If you want to pass a lambda literal to a method that expects a block, prefix the literal with &amp;. data.sort { |a,b| b-a } # The block version data.sort &amp;-&gt;a,b{ b-a } # The lambda literal version Invoking Procs and Lambdas Procs and lambdas are objects, not methods, and they cannot be invoked in the same way that method are. f = Proc.new { |x,y| 1.0/(1.0/x + 1.0/y) } z = f.call(x,y) The Proc class also defines the array access operator to work the same as call. z = f[x,y] An alternative to square brackets, you can use parentheses prefixed with a period. z = f.(x,y) .() is a syntactic-sugar that invokes the call method, and can be used with any object that defines a call method and is not limited to Proc objects.

    <p>It is also possible to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def</code> statement to define a <strong><em>singleton method</em></strong> that is avaiable only on a single object.</p>

    <p>The expression to define a singleton method should be followed by a period and the name of the method to be defined.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  o = "message" # A string is an object
  def o.printme # Define a singleton method for this object
    puts self
  end
  o.printme # Invoke the singleton *Ruby implementations typically treat Fixnum and Symbol values as immediate values rather than as true object references. For this reason, singleton methods may not be defined on Fixnum and Symbol objects. For consistency, singletons are also prohibited on other Numeric objects.*
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undefing Method</p>

    <p>Methods are defined with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def</code> statement and may be undefined with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undef</code> statement.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def sum(x,y); x+y; end # Define a method puts sum(1,2)          # Use it
  undef sum              # And undefine it
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Interestingly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undef</code> can be used to undefine inherited methods, without affecting the definition of the method in the class from which it is inherited.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undef</code> cannot be used to undefine a singleton method.</p>

    <p>Within a class or module, you can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undef_method</code> (a private method of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Module</code>) to undefine methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Method Names</p>

    <p>By convention, method names begin with a lowercase letter.</p>

    <p>When a method name is longer than one word, the usual convention is to separate the words with underscores <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like_this</code> rather than using mixed case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">likeThis</code>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code></p>

        <p>Method names may (but are not required to) end with an equals sign, a question mark, or an exclamation point.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>setter</p>

            <p>An equals sign suffix signifies that the method is a <strong>setter</strong> that can be invoked using assignment syntax.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>predicates</p>

            <p>Any method whose name ends with a question mark are called <strong>predicates</strong> returns one the Boolean value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>, but not required, as any value other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> works like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> when a Boolean value is required that answers the question posed by the method invocation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>mutators</p>

            <p>Any method whose name ends with an exclamation mark should be used with caution.</p>

            <p>Often, methods that end with an exclamation mark are <strong>mutators</strong>, which alter the internal state of an object.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Operator Methods</p>

        <p>Many of Ruby’s operators, sucn as +,*, and even the array operator [], are implemented with methods that you can define in your own classes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Method Aliases</p>

        <p>The keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alias</code> serves to define a new name for an existing method.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  alias aka also_known_as     # alias new_name existing_name
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>Aliasing is not overloading.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def hello                       # A nice simple method
    puts "Hello World"            # Suppose we want to augment it...
  end                             
                                        
  alias original_hello hello      # Give the method a backup name
                                        
  def hello                       # Now we define a new method with the old name
    puts "Your attention please"  # That does some stuff
    original_hello                # Then calls the original method
    puts "This has been a test"   # Then does some more stuff
  end
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Methods and Parentheses</p>

    <p>Ruby allows parentheses to be omitted from most method invocation.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  puts "Hello World"
  puts("Hello World")

  greeting = "Hello"
  size = greeting.length
  size = greeting.length()

  x = 3
  x.between? 1,5
  x.between?(1,5)

  f g x, y        # f((g(x),y) not f(g(x,y)) !!!
  square(2+2)*2   # square(4)*2 = 16*2 = 32
  square (2+2)*2  # square(4*2) = square(8) = 64
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Method Arguments</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Parameter Defaults</p>

        <p>Specify a default value by following the parameter name with an equals sign and a value:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def prefix(s,len=1)
      s[0,len]
  end
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>Argument defaults need not be constants: they may be arbitrary expressions, and can be referred to instance variable and previous parameter in the parameter list.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # Return the last character of s or the substring from index to the end
  def suffix(s, index=s.size-1)
      s[index, s.size-index)
  end
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>Parameter defaults are evaluated when a method is invoked rather than when it is parsed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Variable-Length Argument Lists and Arrays</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # Return the largest of the one or more arugments passed
  def max(first, *rest)
      # Assume that the required first argument is the largest
      max = first
      # Now loop through each of the optional arguments looking for bigger ones
      rest.each {|x| max = x if x &gt; max }
      # Return the largest one we found
      max
  end
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>No more than one parameter may be prefixed with an * and it should be the last parameter of the method, unless the method also has a parameter with an &amp; prefix.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  max(1)      # first=1, rest=[]
  max(1,2)    # first=1, rest=[2]
  max(1,2,3)  # first=1, rest=[2,3]
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Passing arrays to methods</p>

        <p>* can also be used in a method invocation to scatter, expand, or explode the elements of an array (or range or emuerator) so that each element becomes a separate method argument.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  data = [3,2,1]
  m = max(*data)  # first=3, rest=[2,1] =&gt; 3
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mapping Arguments to Parameters</p>

        <p><em>A little bit triky</em>
  <em>To be continued…</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hashes for Named Arguments</p>

        <p>When a method requires more than two or three arguments, it can be difficult for the programmer invoking the method to remember the proper order for those argments.</p>

        <p>Ruby does not support to write method invocations that explicitly specify a parameter name for each arugment that is passed, but it can approximated if you write a method that expects a hash as its argument or as one of its arguments.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # This method returns an array a of n numbers. For any index i, 0 &lt;= i &lt; n,
  # the value of element a[i] is m*i+c. Arguments n, m, and c are passed
  # as keys in a hash, so that it is not necessary to remember their order.
  def sequence(args)
    # Extract the arguments from the hash.
    # Note the use of the || operator to specify defaults used
    # if the hash does not define a key that we are interested in. n = args[:n] || 0
    m = args[:m] || 1
    c = args[:c] || 0
    a = []                    # Start with an empty array
    n.times {|i| a &lt;&lt; m*i+c } # Calculate the value of each array element
    a                         # Return the array
  end
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>You might invoke this method with a hash literal argument like this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  sequence({:n=&gt;3, :m=&gt;5})    # =&gt; [0, 5, 10]
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>In order to better support this style of programming, Ruby allows you to omit the curly braces around the hash literal if it is the last argument to the method (or if the only arugment that follows it is a block argument, prefixed with &amp;).</p>

        <p>A hash without braces is sometinmes called a <strong>bare hash</strong>.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  sequence(:m=&gt;3, :n=&gt;5)      # =&gt; [0, 3, 6, 9, 12]
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>As with other ruby methods, we can omit the parentheses.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  sequence c:1, m:3, n:5      # =&gt; [1, 4, 7, 10, 13]
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>If you omit the paretheses, then you <em>must</em> omit the curly braces.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # Ruby thinks you're passing a block to the method.
  seqence {:m=&gt;3, :n=&gt;5 }     # Syntax error!
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Block Arguments</p>

        <p>Any mehtod invocation may be followed by a block, and any method that has a block associated with it may invoke the code in that block with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code> statement.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # Generate a sequence of n numbers m*i + c and pass them to the block
  def sequence2(n, m, c)
      i = 0
      while(i &lt; n)        # loop n times
          yield i*m + c   # pass next element of the sequence to the block
          i += 1
      end
  end

  # Here is how you might use this verison of the method
  sequence2(5, 2, 2) { |x| puts x } # Print numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>One of the features of blocks is their anonymity.</p>

        <p>If you prefer more explicit control over a block, add a final argument to your method, and prefix the argument name with an ampersand. The value of the argument will be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object, and instead of using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code>, you invoke the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code> method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code>.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def sequence3(n, m, c, &amp;p) # Explicit argument to get block as a Proc
      i = 0
      while(i &lt; n)
          b.call(i*m + c)    # Invoke the Proc with its call method
          i += 1
      end
  end

  # Note that the block is still passed outside of the parentheses
  sequence3(5, 2, 2) { |x| puts x }
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>Notice that using the ampersand in this way changes only the method definition.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Passing Proc Objects Explicityly</p>

            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # This version expects an explicitly-created Proc object, not a block
  def sequence4(n, m, c, b)   # No ampersand used for arguemnt b
      i = 0
      while(i &lt; n)
          b.call(i*m + c)     # Proc is called explicitly
          i += 1
      end
  end

  p = Proc.new { |x| puts x } # Explicity create a Proc object
  sequence4(5, 2, 2, p)       # And pass it as an ordinary argument
</code></pre></div>            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Block arguments prefixed with ampersands must <em>really</em> the last one in the parameter list.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def sequence5(args, &amp;b) # Pass arguments as a hash and follow with a block
      n, m, c = argus[:n], args[:m], args[:c]
      i = 0
      while(i &lt; n)
          b.call(i*m + c)
          i += 1
      end
  end

  # Expects one or more arguments, followed by a block
  def max(first, *rest, &amp;block)
      max = first
      rest.each { |x| max = x if x &gt; max }
      block.call(max)
      max
  end
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code> satement still works in a method defined with an &amp; parameter. Even if the block has been converted to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object and passed as an argument, it can still be invoked as an anonymous block, as if the block argument was not there.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Using &amp; in method invocation</p>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> in a method definition to specify that multiple arguments should be packed into an array</p>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> in a method invocaiton to specify that an array should be upcaked so that its elements become separate arguments</p>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> in a method definition allows an ordinary block associated with a method invocation to be used as a named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object inside the method.</p>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> in a method invocation that before a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object to treat the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> as if it was an ordinary block following the invocation.</p>

        <p>In a mehtod invocation an &amp; typically appears before a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object. But it is accually allowed before any object with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to_proc</code> method (e.g <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Method</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Symbol</code> classes).</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   a, b = [1,2,3], [4,5]                       # Start with some data.

   sum = a.inject(0, &amp;summation)               # =&gt; 6

<h3 id="procs-and-lambdas">Procs and Lambdas</h3>

<p>Blocks are syntactic structures in Ruby; they are not objects, and cannot be manipulated as objects.</p>

<p>Procs have block-like behavior and lambdas have method-like behavior, however, both are instances of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code>.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  succ = lambda { |x| x+1 }
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>In Ruby 1.9, we can convert this to a literal as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Replace the method name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lambda</code> with the punctuation <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>Move the list of arguments outside of and just before the curly braces.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Change the argument list delimiters from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">||</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code>.</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  succ = -&gt;(x){ x+1 }
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A lambda literal uses an arrow made with a hypen, whereas a hash literal uses an arrow made with an equals sign.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # This lambada takes 2 args and declares 3 local vars
  f = -&gt;(x,y; i,j,k) { ... }
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Lambdas can be to declared with argument defaults.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  zoom = -&gt;(x,y,factor=2) { [x*factor, y*factor] }
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>As with method declarations, the parentheses in lambda literals are optional, because the parameter list and localvariable lists are completely delimited by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-&gt;</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{</code>.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  succ = -&gt; { x + 1 }
  f = -&gt; x,y; i,j,k { ... }
  zoom = -&gt; x,y,factor=2 { x*factor, y*factor }
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Lambda parameters and local variables are optional.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  -&gt; {}
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>If you want to pass a lambda literal to a method that expects a block, prefix the literal with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  data.sort { |a,b| b-a }     # The block version
  data.sort &amp;-&gt;a,b{ b-a }     # The lambda literal version
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="invoking-procs-and-lambdas">Invoking Procs and Lambdas</h4>

<p>Procs and lambdas are objects, not methods, and they cannot be invoked in the same way that method are.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>f = Proc.new { |x,y| 1.0/(1.0/x + 1.0/y) }
z = f.call(x,y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> class also defines the array access operator to work the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>z = f[x,y]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An alternative to square brackets, you can use parentheses prefixed with a period.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>z = f.(x,y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.()</code> is a syntactic-sugar that invokes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code> method, and can be used with any object that defines a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code> method and is not limited to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> objects.</p>

<h4 id="how-lambdas-differ-from-procs">How Lambdas Differ from Procs</h4>

<p>A proc is the object form of a block, and it behaves like a block.</p>

<p>A lambda has slightly modified behavior and behaves more like a method than a block.</p>

<p>Calling a proc is like yielding to a block, whereas calling a lambda is like invoking a mehtod.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, you can determine whether a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object is a proc or a lambda with the instance method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lambda?</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Return in blocks, procs, and lambdas</p>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement in a block does not just return from the block to the invoking iterator, it reutrns from the mehtod that invoked the iterator.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def test
      puts "entering method"
      1.times { puts "entering block"; return } # Makes test method return
      puts "exiting method"   # This line is never executed
  end
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>A proc is like a block, so if you call a proc that executes a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement, it attempts to return from the method that encloses the block that was converted to the proc.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def test
      puts "entering method"
      p = Proc.new { puts "entering proc"; return }
      p.call                  # Invoking the proc makes method return
      puts "exiting method"   # This line is never executed.
  end
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement in a proc is triky. (<em>LocalJumpError</em>)</p>

    <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement in a lambda, therefore, returns from the lambda itself, not from the method that surrounds the creation site of the lambda.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  def test
      puts "entering method"
      p = lambda { puts "entering lambda"; return }
      p.call                  # Invoking the lambda does not make the method return
      puts "exiting method"   # This line *is* executed now
  end
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="closures">Closures</h3>

<p>In Ruby, procs and lambdas are <em>closures</em>.</p>

<p>The term “closure” comes from the early days of computer science; it refers to an object that is both an invocable funciton and a varible binding for that funciton.</p>

<p>When you create a proc or a labmda, the resulting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> object holds not just the executable block but also bindings for all the varialbes used by the block.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Closures and Shared Variables</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to understand that a closure does not just retain the value of the variables it refers to—it retains the actual variables and extends their lifetime.</p>

<p>The bindings are dynamic, and the values of the variables are looked up when the lambda or proc is executed.</p>

<p>As an example, the following code defines a method that returns two lambdas. Because the lambdas are defined in the same scope, they share access to the variables in that scope. When on lamda alters the values of a shared varible, the new value is available to the other lambda.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Return a pair of lambdas that share access to a local variable.
def accessor_pair(initial_value=nil)
    value = intiial_value   # A local variable shared by the returned lambdas
    getter = lambda { value }         # Return value of local variable
    setter = lambda { |x| value = x } # Change value of local variable
    return getter, setter
end

getX, setX = accessor_pair(0)   # Create accssor lambdas for initial value 0.
puts getX[]     # Prints 0. Note square brackets instead of call.
set[10]         # Change the value through one closure.
puts getX[]     # Prints 10. The change is visible through the other.
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Closures and Bindings</p>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proc</code> class define a method named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding</code>. Calling this method on a proc or lambda returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binding</code> object that represents the bindings in effect for that closure.</p>

    <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binding</code> object doesn’t have interesting methods of it own, but it can be used as the second argument to the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval</code> fuction`, providing a context in which to evaluate a string of Ruby code.</p>

    <p>In Ruby 1.9, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binding</code> has its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval</code> method.</p>

    <p>The use of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binding</code> object and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval</code> method gives us a back door through which we can manipulate the behavior of a closure.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  # Return a lambda that retains or "closes over" the argument n
  def mulitplier(n)
      lambda { |data| data.collect{ |x| x*n } }
  end
  doubler = multiplier(2)     # Get a lambda that knows how to double
  puts doubler.call([1,2,3])  # Prints 2,4,6

  eval("n=3", doubler.binding) # Or doubler.binding.eval("n=3") in Ruby 1.9
  puts doubler.call([1,2,3])   # Now this pritns 3,6,9!
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Bindings are not only a feature of closures. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kernel.binding</code> method returns a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Binding</code> object that represents the bindings in effect at whatever point you happen to call it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-object">Method Object</h3>

<p>Ruby’s methods and blocks are executable language constructs, but they are not objects.</p>

<p>Procs and lambdas are object versions of blocks; they can be executed and also manipualted as data.</p>

<p>Ruby has powerful metaprogramming (or <em>refleciton</em>) capabilities, and methods can actually be represented as instance of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Method</code> class.</p>

<h3 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h3>

<p>Ruby is not a functional programming language in the way that languages like Lisp and Haskell are, but Ruby’s blocks, procs, and lambdas lend themselves nicely to a funcitonal programming style.</p>
