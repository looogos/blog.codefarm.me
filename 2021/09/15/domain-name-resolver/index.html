<meta name="description" content="Domain Name Domain name syntax Top-level domains Second-level and lower level domains Use in web site hosting Hostname Server Name Indication (SNI) Understanding DNS and name servers DNS Zone List of DNS record types Name Resolver References Domain Name A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites. The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the public. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts. Domain name syntax A domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called labels, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com. The right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com. The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a label to create www.example.com, a subdomain of example.com. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation. Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits. A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address. For example, the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames, whereas the com domain is not. However, other top-level domains, particularly country code top-level domains, may indeed have an IP address, and if so, they are also hostnames. Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name. A valid hostname is also a valid domain name, but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname. Top-level domains When the Domain Name System was devised in the 1980s, the domain name space was divided into two main groups of domains. The country code top-level domains (ccTLD) were primarily based on the two-character territory codes of ISO-3166 country abbreviations. In addition, a group of seven generic top-level domains (gTLD) was implemented which represented a set of categories of names and multi-organizations. These were the domains gov, edu, com, mil, org, net, and int. These two types of top-level domains (TLDs) are the highest level of domain names of the Internet. Top-level domains form the DNS root zone of the hierarchical Domain Name System. Every domain name ends with a top-level domain label. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains an annotated list of top-level domains in the DNS root zone database. Second-level and lower level domains Below the top-level domains in the domain name hierarchy are the second-level domain (SLD) names. These are the names directly to the left of .com, .net, and the other top-level domains. As an example, in the domain example.co.uk, co is the second-level domain. Next are third-level domains, which are written immediately to the left of a second-level domain. There can be fourth- and fifth-level domains, and so on, with virtually no limitation. An example of an operational domain name with four levels of domain labels is sos.state.oh.us. Each label is separated by a full stop (dot). sos is said to be a sub-domain of state.oh.us, and state a sub-domain of oh.us, etc. In general, subdomains are domains subordinate to their parent domain. An example of very deep levels of subdomain ordering are the IPv6 reverse resolution DNS zones, e.g., 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.arpa, which is the reverse DNS resolution domain name for the IP address of a loopback interface, or the localhost name. Second-level (or lower-level, depending on the established parent hierarchy) domain names are often created based on the name of a company (e.g., bbc.co.uk), product or service (e.g. hotmail.com). Below these levels, the next domain name component has been used to designate a particular host server. Therefore, ftp.example.com might be an FTP server, www.example.com would be a World Wide Web server, and mail.example.com could be an email server, each intended to perform only the implied function. Modern technology allows multiple physical servers with either different (cf. load balancing) or even identical addresses (cf. anycast) to serve a single hostname or domain name, or multiple domain names to be served by a single computer. The latter is very popular in Web hosting service centers, where service providers host the websites of many organizations on just a few servers. The hierarchical DNS labels or components of domain names are separated in a fully qualified name by the full stop (dot, .). Use in web site hosting The domain name is a component of a uniform resource locator (URL) used to access web sites, for example: URL: http://www.example.net/index.html Top-level domain: net Second-level domain: example Hostname: www A domain name may point to multiple IP addresses to provide server redundancy for the services offered, a feature that is used to manage the traffic of large, popular web sites. Web hosting services, on the other hand, run servers that are typically assigned only one or a few addresses while serving websites for many domains, a technique referred to as virtual web hosting. Such IP address overloading requires that each request identifies the domain name being referenced, for instance by using the HTTP request header field Host:, or Server Name Indication. Hostname In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the World Wide Web. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured. Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it for routing packets for performance and other reasons. Internet hostnames may have appended the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period (&quot;dot&quot;). In the latter form, a hostname is also called a domain name. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process. Server Name Indication (SNI) Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present one of multiple possible certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based virtual hosting, but for HTTPS. This also allows a proxy to forward client traffic to the right server during TLS/SSL handshake. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested. Understanding DNS and name servers DNS stands for &quot;Domain Name System&quot;. The domain name system acts like a large telephone directory and in that it&#8217;s the master database, which associates a domain name such as www.wikipedia.org with the appropriate IP number. Consider the IP number something similar to a phone number: When someone calls www.wikipedia.org, the ISP looks at the DNS server, and asks &quot;how do I contact www.wikipedia.org?&quot; The DNS server responds, for example, &quot;it can be found at: 91.198.174.192.&quot;. As the Internet understands it, this can be considered the phone number for the server that houses the website. When the domain name is registered/purchased on a particular registrar&#8217;s &quot;name server&quot;, the DNS settings are kept on their server, and in most cases point the domain to the name server of the hosting provider. This name server is where the IP number (currently associated with the domain name) resides. DNS Zone A DNS zone is a specific portion of the DNS namespace in the Domain Name System (DNS), which is managed by a specific organization or administrator. A DNS zone is an administrative space that allows for more granular control of the DNS components, such as authoritative nameserver. The DNS is broken up into many different zones, which are distinctly managed areas in the DNS namespace. DNS zones are not necessarily physically separated from one another, however, a DNS zone can contain multiple subdomains and multiple zones can exist on the same server. The domain namespace of the Internet is organized into a hierarchical layout of subdomains below the DNS root domain. The individual domains of this tree may serve as delegation points for administrative authority and management. However, usually, it is furthermore desirable to implement fine-grained boundaries of delegation, so that multiple sub-levels of a domain may be managed independently. Therefore, the domain name space is partitioned into areas (zones) for this purpose. A zone starts at a domain and extends downward in the tree to the leaf nodes or to the top-level of subdomains where other zones start. A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a domain name server. Historically, it is defined in the zone file, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type Start of Authority (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server (BIND) software package and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. Example 1. An example of a zone file for the domain example.com is the following: $ORIGIN example.com. ; designates the start of this zone file in the namespace $TTL 3600 ; default expiration time (in seconds) of all RRs without their own TTL value example.com. IN SOA ns.example.com. username.example.com. ( 2020091025 7200 3600 1209600 3600 ) example.com. IN NS ns ; ns.example.com is a nameserver for example.com example.com. IN NS ns.somewhere.example. ; ns.somewhere.example is a backup nameserver for example.com example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com. ; mail.example.com is the mailserver for example.com @ IN MX 20 mail2.example.com. ; equivalent to above line, &quot;@&quot; represents zone origin @ IN MX 50 mail3 ; equivalent to above line, but using a relative host name example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1 ; IPv4 address for example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8:10::1 ; IPv6 address for example.com ns IN A 192.0.2.2 ; IPv4 address for ns.example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8:10::2 ; IPv6 address for ns.example.com www IN CNAME example.com. ; www.example.com is an alias for example.com wwwtest IN CNAME www ; wwwtest.example.com is another alias for www.example.com mail IN A 192.0.2.3 ; IPv4 address for mail.example.com mail2 IN A 192.0.2.4 ; IPv4 address for mail2.example.com mail3 IN A 192.0.2.5 ; IPv4 address for mail3.example.com At minimum, the zone file must specify the Start of Authority (SOA) record with the name of the authoritative master name server for the zone and the email address of someone responsible for management of the name server (represented as a domain name, with a full stop character in place of the usual @ symbol). The parameters of the SOA record also specify a list of timing and expiration parameters (serial number, slave refresh period, slave retry time, slave expiration time, and the maximum time to cache the record). Some name servers, including BIND, also require at least one additional NS record. In the zone file, domain names that end with a full stop character (such as &quot;example.com.&quot; in the above example) are fully qualified while those that do not end with a full stop are relative to the current origin (which is why www in the above example refers to www.example.com). List of DNS record types Table 1. Resource records Type Description Function A Address record Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but it is also used for DNSBLs, storing subnet masks in RFC 1101, etc. AAAA IPv6 address record Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host. CNAME Canonical name record Alias of one name to another: the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name. MX Mail exchange record Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain NS Name server record Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers PTR PTR Resource Record Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups, but other uses include such things as DNS-SD. TXT Text record Originally for arbitrary human-readable text in a DNS record. Since the early 1990s, however, this record more often carries machine-readable data, such as specified by RFC 1464, opportunistic encryption, Sender Policy Framework, DKIM, DMARC, DNS-SD, etc. SOA Start of [a zone of] authority record Specifies authoritative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and several timers relating to refreshing the zone. SRV Service locator Generalized service location record, used for newer protocols instead of creating protocol-specific records such as MX. Name Resolver dig is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS). dig is useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. It can operate based on command line option and flag arguments, or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file. When a specific name server is not specified in the command invocation, it uses the operating system&#8217;s default resolver, usually configured in the file resolv.conf. Without any arguments it queries the DNS root zone. dig supports Internationalized domain name (IDN) queries. dig is a component of the domain name server software suite BIND. dig supersedes in functionality older tools, such as nslookup and the program host; however, the older tools are still used in complementary fashion. $ uname -a Linux far-seer-01 4.19.0-17-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.194-3 (2021-07-18) x86_64 GNU/Linux $ which dig /usr/bin/dig $ dpkg -S /usr/bin/dig dnsutils: /usr/bin/dig $ dpkg -s dnsutils Package: dnsutils Status: install ok installed Priority: standard Section: net Installed-Size: 724 Maintainer: Debian DNS Team &lt;team+dns@tracker.debian.org&gt; Architecture: amd64 Source: bind9 Version: 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5 Replaces: bind9 (&lt;&lt; 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6) Depends: bind9-host | host, libbind9-161 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libdns1104 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libisc1100 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libisccfg163 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), liblwres161 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libc6 (&gt;= 2.14), libcap2 (&gt;= 1:2.10), libcom-err2 (&gt;= 1.43.9), libfstrm0 (&gt;= 0.2.0), libgeoip1, libgssapi-krb5-2 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), libidn2-0 (&gt;= 2.0.0), libirs161 (&gt;= 1:9.10.6+dfsg), libjson-c3 (&gt;= 0.10), libk5crypto3 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), libkrb5-3 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), liblmdb0 (&gt;= 0.9.6), libprotobuf-c1 (&gt;= 1.0.0), libssl1.1 (&gt;= 1.1.0), libxml2 (&gt;= 2.6.27) Suggests: rblcheck Breaks: bind9 (&lt;&lt; 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6~) Description: Clients provided with BIND The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) implements an Internet domain name server.

<meta property="og:description" content="Domain Name Domain name syntax Top-level domains Second-level and lower level domains Use in web site hosting Hostname Server Name Indication (SNI) Understanding DNS and name servers DNS Zone List of DNS record types Name Resolver References Domain Name A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites. The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the public. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts. Domain name syntax A domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called labels, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com. The right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com. The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a label to create www.example.com, a subdomain of example.com. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation. Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits. A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address. For example, the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames, whereas the com domain is not. However, other top-level domains, particularly country code top-level domains, may indeed have an IP address, and if so, they are also hostnames. Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name. A valid hostname is also a valid domain name, but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname. Top-level domains When the Domain Name System was devised in the 1980s, the domain name space was divided into two main groups of domains. The country code top-level domains (ccTLD) were primarily based on the two-character territory codes of ISO-3166 country abbreviations. In addition, a group of seven generic top-level domains (gTLD) was implemented which represented a set of categories of names and multi-organizations. These were the domains gov, edu, com, mil, org, net, and int. These two types of top-level domains (TLDs) are the highest level of domain names of the Internet. Top-level domains form the DNS root zone of the hierarchical Domain Name System. Every domain name ends with a top-level domain label. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains an annotated list of top-level domains in the DNS root zone database. Second-level and lower level domains Below the top-level domains in the domain name hierarchy are the second-level domain (SLD) names. These are the names directly to the left of .com, .net, and the other top-level domains. As an example, in the domain example.co.uk, co is the second-level domain. Next are third-level domains, which are written immediately to the left of a second-level domain. There can be fourth- and fifth-level domains, and so on, with virtually no limitation. An example of an operational domain name with four levels of domain labels is sos.state.oh.us. Each label is separated by a full stop (dot). sos is said to be a sub-domain of state.oh.us, and state a sub-domain of oh.us, etc. In general, subdomains are domains subordinate to their parent domain. An example of very deep levels of subdomain ordering are the IPv6 reverse resolution DNS zones, e.g., 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.arpa, which is the reverse DNS resolution domain name for the IP address of a loopback interface, or the localhost name. Second-level (or lower-level, depending on the established parent hierarchy) domain names are often created based on the name of a company (e.g., bbc.co.uk), product or service (e.g. hotmail.com). Below these levels, the next domain name component has been used to designate a particular host server. Therefore, ftp.example.com might be an FTP server, www.example.com would be a World Wide Web server, and mail.example.com could be an email server, each intended to perform only the implied function. Modern technology allows multiple physical servers with either different (cf. load balancing) or even identical addresses (cf. anycast) to serve a single hostname or domain name, or multiple domain names to be served by a single computer. The latter is very popular in Web hosting service centers, where service providers host the websites of many organizations on just a few servers. The hierarchical DNS labels or components of domain names are separated in a fully qualified name by the full stop (dot, .). Use in web site hosting The domain name is a component of a uniform resource locator (URL) used to access web sites, for example: URL: http://www.example.net/index.html Top-level domain: net Second-level domain: example Hostname: www A domain name may point to multiple IP addresses to provide server redundancy for the services offered, a feature that is used to manage the traffic of large, popular web sites. Web hosting services, on the other hand, run servers that are typically assigned only one or a few addresses while serving websites for many domains, a technique referred to as virtual web hosting. Such IP address overloading requires that each request identifies the domain name being referenced, for instance by using the HTTP request header field Host:, or Server Name Indication. Hostname In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the World Wide Web. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured. Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it for routing packets for performance and other reasons. Internet hostnames may have appended the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period (&quot;dot&quot;). In the latter form, a hostname is also called a domain name. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process. Server Name Indication (SNI) Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present one of multiple possible certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based virtual hosting, but for HTTPS. This also allows a proxy to forward client traffic to the right server during TLS/SSL handshake. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested. Understanding DNS and name servers DNS stands for &quot;Domain Name System&quot;. The domain name system acts like a large telephone directory and in that it&#8217;s the master database, which associates a domain name such as www.wikipedia.org with the appropriate IP number. Consider the IP number something similar to a phone number: When someone calls www.wikipedia.org, the ISP looks at the DNS server, and asks &quot;how do I contact www.wikipedia.org?&quot; The DNS server responds, for example, &quot;it can be found at: 91.198.174.192.&quot;. As the Internet understands it, this can be considered the phone number for the server that houses the website. When the domain name is registered/purchased on a particular registrar&#8217;s &quot;name server&quot;, the DNS settings are kept on their server, and in most cases point the domain to the name server of the hosting provider. This name server is where the IP number (currently associated with the domain name) resides. DNS Zone A DNS zone is a specific portion of the DNS namespace in the Domain Name System (DNS), which is managed by a specific organization or administrator. A DNS zone is an administrative space that allows for more granular control of the DNS components, such as authoritative nameserver. The DNS is broken up into many different zones, which are distinctly managed areas in the DNS namespace. DNS zones are not necessarily physically separated from one another, however, a DNS zone can contain multiple subdomains and multiple zones can exist on the same server. The domain namespace of the Internet is organized into a hierarchical layout of subdomains below the DNS root domain. The individual domains of this tree may serve as delegation points for administrative authority and management. However, usually, it is furthermore desirable to implement fine-grained boundaries of delegation, so that multiple sub-levels of a domain may be managed independently. Therefore, the domain name space is partitioned into areas (zones) for this purpose. A zone starts at a domain and extends downward in the tree to the leaf nodes or to the top-level of subdomains where other zones start. A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a domain name server. Historically, it is defined in the zone file, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type Start of Authority (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server (BIND) software package and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. Example 1. An example of a zone file for the domain example.com is the following: $ORIGIN example.com. ; designates the start of this zone file in the namespace $TTL 3600 ; default expiration time (in seconds) of all RRs without their own TTL value example.com. IN SOA ns.example.com. username.example.com. ( 2020091025 7200 3600 1209600 3600 ) example.com. IN NS ns ; ns.example.com is a nameserver for example.com example.com. IN NS ns.somewhere.example. ; ns.somewhere.example is a backup nameserver for example.com example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com. ; mail.example.com is the mailserver for example.com @ IN MX 20 mail2.example.com. ; equivalent to above line, &quot;@&quot; represents zone origin @ IN MX 50 mail3 ; equivalent to above line, but using a relative host name example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1 ; IPv4 address for example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8:10::1 ; IPv6 address for example.com ns IN A 192.0.2.2 ; IPv4 address for ns.example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8:10::2 ; IPv6 address for ns.example.com www IN CNAME example.com. ; www.example.com is an alias for example.com wwwtest IN CNAME www ; wwwtest.example.com is another alias for www.example.com mail IN A 192.0.2.3 ; IPv4 address for mail.example.com mail2 IN A 192.0.2.4 ; IPv4 address for mail2.example.com mail3 IN A 192.0.2.5 ; IPv4 address for mail3.example.com At minimum, the zone file must specify the Start of Authority (SOA) record with the name of the authoritative master name server for the zone and the email address of someone responsible for management of the name server (represented as a domain name, with a full stop character in place of the usual @ symbol). The parameters of the SOA record also specify a list of timing and expiration parameters (serial number, slave refresh period, slave retry time, slave expiration time, and the maximum time to cache the record). Some name servers, including BIND, also require at least one additional NS record. In the zone file, domain names that end with a full stop character (such as &quot;example.com.&quot; in the above example) are fully qualified while those that do not end with a full stop are relative to the current origin (which is why www in the above example refers to www.example.com). List of DNS record types Table 1. Resource records Type Description Function A Address record Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but it is also used for DNSBLs, storing subnet masks in RFC 1101, etc. AAAA IPv6 address record Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host. CNAME Canonical name record Alias of one name to another: the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name. MX Mail exchange record Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain NS Name server record Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers PTR PTR Resource Record Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups, but other uses include such things as DNS-SD. TXT Text record Originally for arbitrary human-readable text in a DNS record. Since the early 1990s, however, this record more often carries machine-readable data, such as specified by RFC 1464, opportunistic encryption, Sender Policy Framework, DKIM, DMARC, DNS-SD, etc. SOA Start of [a zone of] authority record Specifies authoritative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and several timers relating to refreshing the zone. SRV Service locator Generalized service location record, used for newer protocols instead of creating protocol-specific records such as MX. Name Resolver dig is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS). dig is useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. It can operate based on command line option and flag arguments, or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file. When a specific name server is not specified in the command invocation, it uses the operating system&#8217;s default resolver, usually configured in the file resolv.conf. Without any arguments it queries the DNS root zone. dig supports Internationalized domain name (IDN) queries. dig is a component of the domain name server software suite BIND. dig supersedes in functionality older tools, such as nslookup and the program host; however, the older tools are still used in complementary fashion. $ uname -a Linux far-seer-01 4.19.0-17-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.194-3 (2021-07-18) x86_64 GNU/Linux $ which dig /usr/bin/dig $ dpkg -S /usr/bin/dig dnsutils: /usr/bin/dig $ dpkg -s dnsutils Package: dnsutils Status: install ok installed Priority: standard Section: net Installed-Size: 724 Maintainer: Debian DNS Team &lt;team+dns@tracker.debian.org&gt; Architecture: amd64 Source: bind9 Version: 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5 Replaces: bind9 (&lt;&lt; 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6) Depends: bind9-host | host, libbind9-161 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libdns1104 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libisc1100 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libisccfg163 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), liblwres161 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libc6 (&gt;= 2.14), libcap2 (&gt;= 1:2.10), libcom-err2 (&gt;= 1.43.9), libfstrm0 (&gt;= 0.2.0), libgeoip1, libgssapi-krb5-2 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), libidn2-0 (&gt;= 2.0.0), libirs161 (&gt;= 1:9.10.6+dfsg), libjson-c3 (&gt;= 0.10), libk5crypto3 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), libkrb5-3 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), liblmdb0 (&gt;= 0.9.6), libprotobuf-c1 (&gt;= 1.0.0), libssl1.1 (&gt;= 1.1.0), libxml2 (&gt;= 2.6.27) Suggests: rblcheck Breaks: bind9 (&lt;&lt; 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6~) Description: Clients provided with BIND The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) implements an Internet domain name server.

Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites. The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell their services to the public. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts. Domain name syntax A domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called labels, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com. The right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com. The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a label to create www.example.com, a subdomain of example.com. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation. Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits. A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address. For example, the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames, whereas the com domain is not. However, other top-level domains, particularly country code top-level domains, may indeed have an IP address, and if so, they are also hostnames. Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name. A valid hostname is also a valid domain name, but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname. Top-level domains When the Domain Name System was devised in the 1980s, the domain name space was divided into two main groups of domains. The country code top-level domains (ccTLD) were primarily based on the two-character territory codes of ISO-3166 country abbreviations. In addition, a group of seven generic top-level domains (gTLD) was implemented which represented a set of categories of names and multi-organizations. These were the domains gov, edu, com, mil, org, net, and int. These two types of top-level domains (TLDs) are the highest level of domain names of the Internet. Top-level domains form the DNS root zone of the hierarchical Domain Name System. Every domain name ends with a top-level domain label. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains an annotated list of top-level domains in the DNS root zone database. Second-level and lower level domains Below the top-level domains in the domain name hierarchy are the second-level domain (SLD) names. These are the names directly to the left of .com, .net, and the other top-level domains. As an example, in the domain example.co.uk, co is the second-level domain. Next are third-level domains, which are written immediately to the left of a second-level domain. There can be fourth- and fifth-level domains, and so on, with virtually no limitation. An example of an operational domain name with four levels of domain labels is sos.state.oh.us. Each label is separated by a full stop (dot). sos is said to be a sub-domain of state.oh.us, and state a sub-domain of oh.us, etc. In general, subdomains are domains subordinate to their parent domain. An example of very deep levels of subdomain ordering are the IPv6 reverse resolution DNS zones, e.g., 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.arpa, which is the reverse DNS resolution domain name for the IP address of a loopback interface, or the localhost name. Second-level (or lower-level, depending on the established parent hierarchy) domain names are often created based on the name of a company (e.g., bbc.co.uk), product or service (e.g. hotmail.com). Below these levels, the next domain name component has been used to designate a particular host server. Therefore, ftp.example.com might be an FTP server, www.example.com would be a World Wide Web server, and mail.example.com could be an email server, each intended to perform only the implied function. Modern technology allows multiple physical servers with either different (cf. load balancing) or even identical addresses (cf. anycast) to serve a single hostname or domain name, or multiple domain names to be served by a single computer. The latter is very popular in Web hosting service centers, where service providers host the websites of many organizations on just a few servers. The hierarchical DNS labels or components of domain names are separated in a fully qualified name by the full stop (dot, .). Use in web site hosting The domain name is a component of a uniform resource locator (URL) used to access web sites, for example: URL: http://www.example.net/index.html Top-level domain: net Second-level domain: example Hostname: www A domain name may point to multiple IP addresses to provide server redundancy for the services offered, a feature that is used to manage the traffic of large, popular web sites. Web hosting services, on the other hand, run servers that are typically assigned only one or a few addresses while serving websites for many domains, a technique referred to as virtual web hosting. Such IP address overloading requires that each request identifies the domain name being referenced, for instance by using the HTTP request header field Host:, or Server Name Indication. Hostname In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the World Wide Web. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured. Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it for routing packets for performance and other reasons. Internet hostnames may have appended the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period (&quot;dot&quot;). In the latter form, a hostname is also called a domain name. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process. Server Name Indication (SNI) Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present one of multiple possible certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based virtual hosting, but for HTTPS. This also allows a proxy to forward client traffic to the right server during TLS/SSL handshake. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested. Understanding DNS and name servers DNS stands for &quot;Domain Name System&quot;. The domain name system acts like a large telephone directory and in that it&#8217;s the master database, which associates a domain name such as www.wikipedia.org with the appropriate IP number. Consider the IP number something similar to a phone number: When someone calls www.wikipedia.org, the ISP looks at the DNS server, and asks &quot;how do I contact www.wikipedia.org?&quot; The DNS server responds, for example, &quot;it can be found at: 91.198.174.192.&quot;. As the Internet understands it, this can be considered the phone number for the server that houses the website. When the domain name is registered/purchased on a particular registrar&#8217;s &quot;name server&quot;, the DNS settings are kept on their server, and in most cases point the domain to the name server of the hosting provider. This name server is where the IP number (currently associated with the domain name) resides. DNS Zone A DNS zone is a specific portion of the DNS namespace in the Domain Name System (DNS), which is managed by a specific organization or administrator. A DNS zone is an administrative space that allows for more granular control of the DNS components, such as authoritative nameserver. The DNS is broken up into many different zones, which are distinctly managed areas in the DNS namespace. DNS zones are not necessarily physically separated from one another, however, a DNS zone can contain multiple subdomains and multiple zones can exist on the same server. The domain namespace of the Internet is organized into a hierarchical layout of subdomains below the DNS root domain. The individual domains of this tree may serve as delegation points for administrative authority and management. However, usually, it is furthermore desirable to implement fine-grained boundaries of delegation, so that multiple sub-levels of a domain may be managed independently. Therefore, the domain name space is partitioned into areas (zones) for this purpose. A zone starts at a domain and extends downward in the tree to the leaf nodes or to the top-level of subdomains where other zones start. A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a domain name server. Historically, it is defined in the zone file, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type Start of Authority (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server (BIND) software package and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. Example 1. An example of a zone file for the domain example.com is the following: $ORIGIN example.com. ; designates the start of this zone file in the namespace $TTL 3600 ; default expiration time (in seconds) of all RRs without their own TTL value example.com. IN SOA ns.example.com. username.example.com. ( 2020091025 7200 3600 1209600 3600 ) example.com. IN NS ns ; ns.example.com is a nameserver for example.com example.com. IN NS ns.somewhere.example. ; ns.somewhere.example is a backup nameserver for example.com example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com. ; mail.example.com is the mailserver for example.com @ IN MX 20 mail2.example.com. ; equivalent to above line, &quot;@&quot; represents zone origin @ IN MX 50 mail3 ; equivalent to above line, but using a relative host name example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1 ; IPv4 address for example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8:10::1 ; IPv6 address for example.com ns IN A 192.0.2.2 ; IPv4 address for ns.example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8:10::2 ; IPv6 address for ns.example.com www IN CNAME example.com. ; www.example.com is an alias for example.com wwwtest IN CNAME www ; wwwtest.example.com is another alias for www.example.com mail IN A 192.0.2.3 ; IPv4 address for mail.example.com mail2 IN A 192.0.2.4 ; IPv4 address for mail2.example.com mail3 IN A 192.0.2.5 ; IPv4 address for mail3.example.com At minimum, the zone file must specify the Start of Authority (SOA) record with the name of the authoritative master name server for the zone and the email address of someone responsible for management of the name server (represented as a domain name, with a full stop character in place of the usual @ symbol). The parameters of the SOA record also specify a list of timing and expiration parameters (serial number, slave refresh period, slave retry time, slave expiration time, and the maximum time to cache the record). Some name servers, including BIND, also require at least one additional NS record. In the zone file, domain names that end with a full stop character (such as &quot;example.com.&quot; in the above example) are fully qualified while those that do not end with a full stop are relative to the current origin (which is why www in the above example refers to www.example.com). List of DNS record types Table 1. Resource records Type Description Function A Address record Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host, but it is also used for DNSBLs, storing subnet masks in RFC 1101, etc. AAAA IPv6 address record Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address, most commonly used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host. CNAME Canonical name record Alias of one name to another: the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the new name. MX Mail exchange record Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain NS Name server record Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers PTR PTR Resource Record Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups, but other uses include such things as DNS-SD. TXT Text record Originally for arbitrary human-readable text in a DNS record. Since the early 1990s, however, this record more often carries machine-readable data, such as specified by RFC 1464, opportunistic encryption, Sender Policy Framework, DKIM, DMARC, DNS-SD, etc. SOA Start of [a zone of] authority record Specifies authoritative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and several timers relating to refreshing the zone. SRV Service locator Generalized service location record, used for newer protocols instead of creating protocol-specific records such as MX. Name Resolver dig is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS). dig is useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. It can operate based on command line option and flag arguments, or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file. When a specific name server is not specified in the command invocation, it uses the operating system&#8217;s default resolver, usually configured in the file resolv.conf. Without any arguments it queries the DNS root zone. dig supports Internationalized domain name (IDN) queries. dig is a component of the domain name server software suite BIND. dig supersedes in functionality older tools, such as nslookup and the program host; however, the older tools are still used in complementary fashion. $ uname -a Linux far-seer-01 4.19.0-17-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.194-3 (2021-07-18) x86_64 GNU/Linux $ which dig /usr/bin/dig $ dpkg -S /usr/bin/dig dnsutils: /usr/bin/dig $ dpkg -s dnsutils Package: dnsutils Status: install ok installed Priority: standard Section: net Installed-Size: 724 Maintainer: Debian DNS Team &lt;team+dns@tracker.debian.org&gt; Architecture: amd64 Source: bind9 Version: 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5 Replaces: bind9 (&lt;&lt; 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6) Depends: bind9-host | host, libbind9-161 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libdns1104 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libisc1100 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libisccfg163 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), liblwres161 (= 1:9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1+deb10u5), libc6 (&gt;= 2.14), libcap2 (&gt;= 1:2.10), libcom-err2 (&gt;= 1.43.9), libfstrm0 (&gt;= 0.2.0), libgeoip1, libgssapi-krb5-2 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), libidn2-0 (&gt;= 2.0.0), libirs161 (&gt;= 1:9.10.6+dfsg), libjson-c3 (&gt;= 0.10), libk5crypto3 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), libkrb5-3 (&gt;= 1.6.dfsg.2), liblmdb0 (&gt;= 0.9.6), libprotobuf-c1 (&gt;= 1.0.0), libssl1.1 (&gt;= 1.1.0), libxml2 (&gt;= 2.6.27) Suggests: rblcheck Breaks: bind9 (&lt;&lt; 1:9.11.2+dfsg-6~) Description: Clients provided with BIND The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) implements an Internet domain name server.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>domain name</strong> is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_domain">network domain</a>, or it represents an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root">DNS root</a> domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">top-level domains</a> (<strong>TLD</strong>s), including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">generic top-level domains</a> (<strong>gTLD</strong>s), such as the prominent domains <code>com</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>net</code>, <code>edu</code>, and <code>org</code>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain">country code top-level domains</a> (<strong>ccTLD</strong>s). Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the <strong>second-level and third-level domain names</strong> that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The registration of these domain names is usually administered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar">domain name registrars</a> who sell their services to the public.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name">fully qualified domain name</a> (<strong>FQDN</strong>) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. <strong>Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree.</strong> Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="domain-name-syntax">Domain name syntax</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called <strong>labels</strong>, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by <strong>dots</strong>, such as <code>example.com</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The right-most label conveys the <strong>top-level domain</strong>; for example, the domain name <code>www.example.com</code> belongs to the top-level domain <code>com</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or <strong>subdomain</strong> of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node <code>example.com</code> as a subdomain of the <code>com</code> domain, and <code>www</code> is a label to create <code>www.example.com</code>, a subdomain of <code>example.com</code>. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. <strong>The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot.</strong> The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation. Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>hostname</strong> is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address. For example, the domain names <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>example.com</code> are also hostnames, whereas the <code>com</code> domain is not. However, other top-level domains, particularly country code top-level domains, may indeed have an IP address, and if so, they are also hostnames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name. <strong>A valid hostname is also a valid domain name, but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="top-level-domains">Top-level domains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Domain Name System was devised in the 1980s, the domain name space was divided into two main groups of domains. The country code top-level domains (<strong>ccTLD</strong>) were primarily based on the two-character territory codes of ISO-3166 country abbreviations. In addition, a group of seven generic top-level domains (<strong>gTLD</strong>) was implemented which represented a set of categories of names and multi-organizations. These were the domains <code>gov</code>, <code>edu</code>, <code>com</code>, <code>mil</code>, <code>org</code>, <code>net</code>, and <code>int</code>. These two types of top-level domains (TLDs) are the highest level of domain names of the Internet. Top-level domains form the DNS root zone of the hierarchical Domain Name System. Every domain name ends with a top-level domain label.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a> (IANA) maintains an annotated list of top-level domains in the DNS root zone database.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="second-level-and-lower-level-domains">Second-level and lower level domains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below the top-level domains in the domain name hierarchy are the second-level domain (<strong>SLD</strong>) names. These are the names directly to the left of <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, and the other top-level domains. As an example, in the domain <code>example.co.uk</code>, <code>co</code> is the second-level domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next are <em>third-level domains</em>, which are written immediately to the left of a second-level domain. There can be <em>fourth- and fifth-level domains</em>, and so on, with virtually no limitation. An example of an operational domain name with four levels of domain labels is <code>sos.state.oh.us</code>. Each label is separated by a full stop (dot). <code>sos</code> is said to be a sub-domain of <code>state.oh.us</code>, and <code>state</code> a sub-domain of <code>oh.us</code>, etc. In general, subdomains are domains subordinate to their parent domain. An example of very deep levels of subdomain ordering are the IPv6 reverse resolution DNS zones, e.g., 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.arpa, which is the reverse DNS resolution domain name for the IP address of a loopback interface, or the localhost name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second-level (or lower-level, depending on the established parent hierarchy) domain names are often created based on the name of a company (e.g., bbc.co.uk), product or service (e.g. hotmail.com). Below these levels, the next domain name component has been used to designate a particular host server. Therefore, ftp.example.com might be an FTP server, www.example.com would be a World Wide Web server, and mail.example.com could be an email server, each intended to perform only the implied function. Modern technology allows multiple physical servers with either different (cf. load balancing) or even identical addresses (cf. anycast) to serve a single hostname or domain name, or multiple domain names to be served by a single computer. The latter is very popular in Web hosting service centers, where service providers host the websites of many organizations on just a few servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hierarchical DNS labels or components of domain names are separated in a fully qualified name by the full stop (dot, .).</p>

<h3 id="use-in-web-site-hosting">Use in web site hosting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The domain name is a component of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator">uniform resource locator</a> (URL) used to access web sites, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>URL: <a href="http://www.example.net/index.html" class="bare">http://www.example.net/index.html</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Second-level domain: example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hostname: www</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A domain name may point to multiple IP addresses to provide server redundancy for the services offered, a feature that is used to manage the traffic of large, popular web sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web hosting services, on the other hand, run servers that are typically assigned only one or a few addresses while serving websites for many domains, a technique referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_web_hosting">virtual web hosting</a>. Such IP address overloading requires that each request identifies the domain name being referenced, for instance by using the HTTP request header field <strong>Host:</strong>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">Server Name Indication</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="hostname">Hostname</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking">computer networking</a>, a <strong>hostname</strong> (archaically <strong>nodename</strong>) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the World Wide Web. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured. Each hostname usually has at least one numeric network address associated with it for routing packets for performance and other reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internet hostnames may have appended the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period ("dot"). In the latter form, a hostname is also called a domain name. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Hostnames that include DNS domains are often stored in the Domain Name System together with the IP addresses of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="server-name-indication-sni">Server Name Indication (SNI)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Server Name Indication</strong> (SNI) is an extension to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostname</a> it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present one of multiple possible certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a>) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. It is the conceptual equivalent to HTTP/1.1 name-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service">virtual hosting</a>, but for HTTPS. This also allows a proxy to forward client traffic to the right server during TLS/SSL handshake. The desired hostname is not encrypted in the original SNI extension, so an eavesdropper can see which site is being requested.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-dns-and-name-servers">Understanding DNS and name servers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DNS stands for "Domain Name System". The domain name system acts like a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory">telephone directory</a> and in that it&#8217;s the master database, which associates a domain name such as <code>www.wikipedia.org</code> with the appropriate IP number. Consider the IP number something similar to a phone number: When someone calls <code>www.wikipedia.org</code>, the ISP looks at the DNS server, and asks "how do I contact <code>www.wikipedia.org</code>?" The DNS server responds, for example, "it can be found at: <code>91.198.174.192</code>.". As the Internet understands it, this can be considered the phone number for the server that houses the website. When the domain name is registered/purchased on a particular registrar&#8217;s "name server", the DNS settings are kept on their server, and in most cases point the domain to the name server of the hosting provider. This name server is where the IP number (currently associated with the domain name) resides.</p>

<h2 id="dns-zone">DNS Zone</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>DNS zone</strong> is a specific portion of the DNS namespace in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS), which is managed by a specific organization or administrator. A DNS zone is an administrative space that allows for more granular control of the DNS components, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server">authoritative nameserver</a>. The DNS is broken up into many different zones, which are distinctly managed areas in the DNS namespace. DNS zones are not necessarily physically separated from one another, however, a DNS zone can contain multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain">subdomains</a> and multiple zones can exist on the same server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The domain namespace of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> is organized into a hierarchical layout of subdomains below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root">DNS root</a> domain. The individual domains of this tree may serve as delegation points for administrative authority and management. However, usually, it is furthermore desirable to implement fine-grained boundaries of delegation, so that multiple sub-levels of a domain may be managed independently. Therefore, the domain name space is partitioned into areas (zones) for this purpose. A zone starts at a domain and extends downward in the tree to the leaf nodes or to the top-level of subdomains where other zones start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server">domain name server</a>. Historically, it is defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file">zone file</a>, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type <strong><em>Start of Authority</em></strong> (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND">Berkeley Internet Name Domain</a> Server (BIND) software package and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At minimum, the zone file must specify the <em>Start of Authority</em> (SOA) record with the name of the authoritative master name server for the zone and the email address of someone responsible for management of the name server (represented as a domain name, with a full stop character in place of the usual @ symbol). The parameters of the SOA record also specify a list of timing and expiration parameters (serial number, slave refresh period, slave retry time, slave expiration time, and the maximum time to cache the record). Some name servers, including BIND, also require at least one additional <em>NS</em> record.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the zone file, domain names that end with a full stop character (such as "<em>example.com.</em>" in the above example) are <em>fully qualified</em> while those that do not end with a full stop are <em>relative</em> to the current origin (which is why <em>www</em> in the above example refers to <em>www.example.com</em>).</p>
